# Content Vault

Processed bookmarks and saved content, organized for retrieval.

## Structure

- `bookmarks.md` — Ingested Twitter bookmarks with summaries and tags
- `articles.md` — Longer-form content (if added later)
- `ideas.md` — Peter's own ideas captured along the way

## How It Works

1. Peter bookmarks on Twitter
2. North pulls new bookmarks daily
3. Each gets: summary, focus area tags, key takeaways
4. When working on a focus area, North searches here for relevant context

## Tags

Mapped to MASTER_PLAN.md focus areas:
`family` `faith` `health` `business` `career` `money` `growth` `home` `freedom`

Sub-tags: `business/hct` `business/returnzap` `money/dividends` `money/trading` `money/crypto` etc.
