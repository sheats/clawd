# February Habit: Morning Movement

**Goal:** 30 minutes of movement before 7am, every day

## The Routine (Variable)

Mix and match based on how you feel:
- **Option A:** 30 min walking (treadmill)
- **Option B:** 10 min walking + 20 min knee strengthening (Knees Over Toes Guy)
- **Option C:** 15 min walking + 15 min stretching

## Supporting Systems

### Sleep (Required for this to work)
- **Bedtime:** 10pm hard cutoff
- **Goal:** Fall asleep quickly, Oura crowns
- **Track:** Oura ring

### Sleep Quality Fixes to Explore
- [ ] Mouth taping at night (fixes mouth breathing, may reduce snoring)
- [ ] Research: why bad morning breath? (likely mouth breathing)
- [ ] Snoring solutions (mouth tape? sleep position? weight loss helps too)

## Accountability

**Beeminder + iFit integration**
- iFit tracks treadmill sessions
- Beeminder creates commitment device
- Research: does Beeminder have iFit integration? Or use Zapier/API?

## Success Metrics

- [ ] 25+ days of morning movement in February
- [ ] Average wake time before 6:30am
- [ ] Oura sleep score trend improving
- [ ] Knee pain/mobility improving (subjective)

## Notes

- This habit unlocks the health domino: sleep → wake early → move → energy → focus
- Knee rehab is both fitness AND injury recovery (from skiing)
