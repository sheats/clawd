## Framework Decision

Peter chose to combine three productivity frameworks:
- **Essentialism** — daily/weekly focus filter ("What's essential?")
- **12 Week Year (Monthly Edition)** — starting with monthly cycles, may scale to quarters later
- **Atomic Habits** — one new habit per month

## February Habit: Morning Movement

**Goal:** 30 minutes of movement before 7am, every day

**Routine (variable):**
- Option A: 30 min walking (treadmill)
- Option B: 10 min walking + 20 min knee strengthening (Knees Over Toes Guy / Ben Patrick)
- Option C: 15 min walking + 15 min stretching

**Supporting systems:**
- Bedtime: 10pm hard cutoff
- Sleep tracking: Oura ring, aim for crowns
- Accountability: Beeminder + iFit (TBD integration)

**Sleep quality experiments:**
- Mouth taping (3M Micropore or SomniFix)
- Nasal dilators (AIRMAX)
- Tongue scraper
- Peter ordered/researching these on Amazon

**Strategy doc:** `memory/strategies/february-habit-morning-movement.md`

## Cron Jobs Added

- **returnzap-evening-focus** (8pm daily) — Ask Peter for tomorrow's ONE ReturnZap focus, add to Todoist

## MAGA Info Product Business Plan 🔥

**Major project initiated.** Peter asked if I could help build a digital info product business targeting MAGA 50+ demographic.

**Key decisions:**
- Niche: Survival/Preparedness + Health Autonomy intersection
- Approach: **Fully anonymous/faceless** — no face, no real name
- Brand: Pseudonymous (e.g., "American Preparedness Co." or similar)
- Content: Blog + SEO + email primary, faceless YouTube secondary
- Voice: AI (ElevenLabs) or hired Fiverr voice actor

**AI leverage:** ~80% of work (all content creation, research, video production)
**Peter's role:** ~20% (approvals, accounts/payments, strategic decisions)

**Timeline:**
- $1k/month: 4-6 months
- $10k/month: 10-15 months

**Why faceless matters:**
- More scalable
- Replicable to other niches
- Less of Peter's time required
- Many successful info products are completely faceless

**Full plan:** `projects/maga-info-product/PLAN.md`

## Todoist Tasks (Today)

- Morning routine (9am)
- ReturnZap deep work (p1)
- Merge and deploy HQ (p2)
- February planning session (tomorrow, p3)

## Key Insight

Peter's vision for "AI Acceleration" season is becoming clearer:
- Use AI to build businesses with minimal personal time investment
- Faceless/anonymous brands that can be templated
- Scale through systems, not personal presence
- Multiple income streams from replicable playbooks
