# Brain Dump - January 27, 2026

## Context
Peter wants to focus, reduce mental clutter, figure out what to do NOW and TOMORROW.

---

## Current Focus & Tension

**ReturnZap gets almost all attention** — and that's probably right because:
- Paying the bills
- Has the most potential right now
- Has a partner (David)
- Decided a while ago to go all-in so he wouldn't need another job

**But there's pull toward:**
- Options trading
- High-yield ETF investments
- $200K cash sitting uninvested (supposed to be buffer)

---

## Financial Snapshot

Link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SjY21QzGzytT4VXxo9CKkvG94D6Ei95mNcg0ShMAxSY/edit?usp=sharing

**Key Numbers (as of 9/9/24):**
- Net worth: ~$2.3M
- Cash buffer (Wealthfront): ~$211K
- Passive cashflow: ~$12K/month
- Monthly spend: ~$13K/month
- Gap: ~$1K/month

**ReturnZap:** $250K equity, $6.5K/mo cashflow — main engine

---

## Why Multiple Income Streams?

> "I would feel better if I had multiple streams of income coming in so that I could feel more secure and grow wealth faster"

---

## High Cotton

- Another solid business he wants to grow
- **Problem:** Not enough time/capacity to put toward it

---

## Investing Interests

**Fascinated by:**
- Value investing
- Trying to beat the market (knows it's "usually called futile")
- Believes AI agents + clear rules could find opportunities

**Self-awareness:**
> "I've definitely always looked for shortcuts"

**Track record:**
- Wealth came from building startups (equity)
- Crypto: Grew $100K → $1.7M, but didn't pull money out, most crashed
- Current crypto: ~$50K in assets (needs cleanup)
- Feels like maybe broke even on crypto, probably not

---

## Crypto Cleanup Needed

Wants to:
- Go through all crypto holdings
- Figure out strategy: what to keep, what to sell
- Make sure he knows where everything is

---

## Investment Research Tool Idea

**Pain point:** Wants to track investments without spending tons of time

**Desired features:**
- Tell it "I care about this project" (crypto or stock)
- Examples: ShareRing, Devve
- Aggregates:
  - New YouTube videos about it
  - Rumors
  - Important Telegram chats
  - Key Twitter/X posts
- Weekly check-in or email digest
- Sentiment analysis (is it going in the right direction?)
- Objective good/bad things compiled by AI

**Question:** Does something like this already exist?

---

## High Cotton Vision

- Wants to use AI tools to scale it (can't afford people yet)
- Vision: Could be as big as Southern Tide or Vineyard Vines
- Good brand name, believes he can make it work
- Goal: Consistent growth engine via AI until it can pay for people

---

## Meta-Strategy: AI Brand Factory

Idea: For each interest (options trading, dividend investing, etc.), spin up an AI project that:
- Writes software / builds tools and products
- Creates personalities on X/Twitter and other platforms
- Builds an audience
- Sells to that audience

Essentially: Replicate the faceless AI-powered brand model across multiple niches

---

## Health & Time Constraints

- Wants to get healthier, sleep better
- Has a toddler (Ezra) — lots of time disruption
- Doesn't get a solid 40-hour week
- Constantly helping wife with baby

**The Childcare ROI Question:**
- They struggle to make decisions on babysitting
- Don't want to spend the money
- But: how much is it worth to have more help so both can focus on work?

---

## To Sort

- What to do tonight/tomorrow
- Prioritize: ReturnZap vs High Cotton vs investing vs AI projects
- Decision on the $200K cash
- Crypto audit plan
- Childcare decision
