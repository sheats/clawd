ok, explain why you think these are the right niches? what data are you basing that on?
```

## 17:22 EST
```
haha, how can we stop this from happenning? read https://github.com/sheats/clawd/blob/main/projects/maga-info-product/PLAN.md to catch up
```

## 17:23 EST
```
it should be a local file
```

## 21:02 EST
```
ok, that's fine... ok, put this in my future projects section in my master plan, just a link to it
```

## 21:03 EST
```
Do we still need to work on my master plan?
```

## 21:09 EST
```
yeah, i need to focus on what to do right now and tomorrow to move the needle, focus, reduce clutter in my brain
```

## 21:15 EST
```
Okay so it feels like almost all my attention goes to returns up. And I think that that is definitely good because this is what's paying my bills and has the most potential right now because I've got a partner his name is David. And I decided a while ago that I needed to go all in on this so that I could earn enough money from a business that I own to support my life and I wouldn't have to find another job. Along the way though I have wanted to dabble with options trading and high yield ETF investments. I've got $200,000 cash that's not invested. That's supposed to be my buffer right? here's a financial snapshot https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SjY21QzGzytT4VXxo9CKkvG94D6Ei95mNcg0ShMAxSY/edit?usp=sharing
```

## 21:15 EST
```
i want to dump more, so hold on responding too much
```

## 21:17 EST
```
To answer that question I think I would feel better if I had multiple streams of income coming in so that I could feel more secure and grow wealth faster
```

## 21:19 EST
```
So then obviously I have High Cotton out here which I think is another solid business thing that I want to grow. I don't have enough time and capacity to put to that . Also am fascinated by value investing as well as just investing in good opportunities and I guess trying to beat the market even though I know that is usually called futile. But some people do and I guess I figure with using AI agents and putting together some really clear rules, I could probably find some opportunities that could do really well. I guess one thing to know about me is I've definitely always looked for shortcuts. I don't know if they haven't really worked out because my wealth has come from building two other startups that I owned equity in. I did really well in crypto. I was able to grow $100,000 all the way up to $1.7 million. But of course as I sold that project and re-invested it in other things, it all pretty much crashed and I didn't pull hardly any money out of crypto. So I don't know how much I've lost on crypto. I feel like I've maybe broken even but I don't think so. So right now I have like $50,000 of assets in crypto. I'd like to go through that and clean it up and try to figure out a strategy of what to keep and what to sell, making sure I know where everything I own is.
```

## 21:28 EST
```
One of the things that I really want to do is create some sort of research tool. You know there's projects that I follow that I've invested in crypto and it also applies to stocks investments. I would love to get notified of just important information related to what I'm really interested in. This may exist out there; let me know if something exists out there where I can pretty much say, "I care about this crypto project." "sharering" or devve for example, and then I can just kind of see a clear idea of basically new YouTube videos that were posted about it, rumors, important Telegram chats, key X Twitter things. I can just kind of check in once a week or get an email that basically allows me to keep track of my investment without having to spend a bunch of time on it. Would also be great to kind of expose sentiment and do we think it's going in the right direction? Objectively good and bad things about it that are all put together by AI agents.
```

## 21:28 EST
```
make suer you are saving all this somewhere we can reuse
```

## 21:29 EST
```
So yeah I have I think I did I say something about high cotton? But I wanna be using all the new AI tools to basically scale that. It doesn't make enough money to pay for people to do things and I'd love to just see a consistent growth engine by leveraging whatever we can until I can pay people to work for me in High Cotton. I think it could be something as big as Southern Tide and similar like Vineyard Vines. It's a good brand name and I can probably make it work.
```

## 21:30 EST
```
Of course I struggle with not having enough time to do all these things. I guess while I'm talking about business ideas, I've got the idea that for each of these things (say option trading or dividend investing) to essentially spin up an AI project that writes software for me to build tools and products, creates personalities on X, Twitter and other platforms, and basically builds an audience that then continues to sell things to them
```

## 21:31 EST
```
Of course I want to be getting healthier and getting a night's sleep and all that stuff. Seems like it's always elusive to me of course I have a toddler/baby that requires a lot of time. My time gets disrupted a lot. I don't get a good 40-hour week because I'm constantly helping out my wife. We struggle just to make decisions on babysitting and because we don't want to spend the money, there's like this question of how much is it worth to have more help with the baby so that I can focus more on work and she can focus on her work?
```

## 21:31 EST
```
ok, that's probably enough for now
```

## 21:38 EST
```
that makes sense... btw, my partner david and i are having a strategy meeting tomorrow at 3:30... send me some questions and thoughts or maybe we can brainstrom in the morning to make the most of that... the idea on our mind is what does it take to get to $1M in ARR, and what does it take to get to $5M ARR, related to books that says it's easier to 10x than 2x and all that (scince of scaling). research returnzap.com, our competition, and positining, and growth paths tonight for me and give me some thoughts in the morning. save all your work of course. right now we are committed to taking $12,500/month out each and we are at 40K MRR, with additional revenue from overages and label sales. review our backlog on the github project and recently completed/closed issues to get a sense of what we could work on. — do this with a sub agent or something now and send it to me when done
```

## 21:38 EST
```
back to baby sitting, we are in raleigh, north raleigh, what are some ideas for cost effective baby care
```

## 21:41 EST
```
My favorite idea is to get a self driving Tesla that I can use which gives me those 40 minutes to ideally work on my laptop although I don't know if that's feasible so I guess it doesn't really if not then I'm just kind of scrolling my phone maybe I don't know if that's even allowed
```

## 21:42 EST
```
OK, I like your options. Carpooling for Malachi doesn't work cause he's going to have baseball practice after school. That sounds a little complicated Uber that's nice. I'll have to check with Amanda if she feels comfortable with that. I thought about her taking down and taking time I see the school two days a week, but it's not great about that is she doesn't really want to be stuck down there all day and I am here managing Ezra and the babysitters
```

## 21:43 EST
```
link me
```

## 21:43 EST
```
commit everythig outstanding and push
```

## 21:46 EST
```
i'm getting a 404 on that link
```

## 21:46 EST
```
did you add everything to the repo and push?
```

## 21:47 EST
```
where did you go?
```

## 22:34 EST
```
No
```

## 22:38 EST
```
I'm wrapping up, but I just wanted to mention that I had a conversation with my wife to strategize the baby Care stuff and it sounds like if she can have a car available then she would be open to just staying home and bringing in babysitters to give herself a break she doesn't want to send the baby off to one of these Daycare things cause he's only one and doesn't want. I'm getting sick all the time we didn't give him any vaccinations so we wanted him to grow and get a healthy immune system, etc. etc. so the situation that we are dealing with is that my son is 18. We have two cars so my 18-year-old old drives it to school every day it's a 21 Subaru or something maybe a 23 I don't know and then I take my 13 year-old to school down in Garner, which is like a 35 minute sometimes 40 minute drive and I have an office down there that I'm paying $600 a month that's right down the street from my sons Timothy's school so basically I drop him off around 8:30 and then I wanna go to planet fitness right around the corner and then go to my office and work there until I have to pick up my son around 315 and then I drive back so couple things I've thought about so our other car is a 2025 Honda pilot and that's what I drive so question is how can I get a car for my wife while both my 18-year-old and I are gone
```

## 22:41 EST
```
OK, so if I work from home, that means I have to take Timothy down there and somebody has to pick him up in the afternoon. Did you forget about that if you think we can get a 6K Honda Civic somewhere why don't you links
```

## 22:44 EST
```
OK, so I want to catalog a different business idea here so I have Long had the passion to basically help young folks teenagers early 20s and then eventually anybody doesn't really matter your age make good financially literate decisions so we all know that high schools and colleges don't teach financial literacy any college kids just get a credit card at age at college and then they get debt and then they borrowed a buy car and I don't know what all the terms are in this and that and they just kind of stumbled their way through life so I just thought it'd be interesting to create an iPhone mobile device base game that essentially is kind of like a turn based game where you go once by month is starting at age 18 and you make different decisions...
