## Ingredients
- 3 pounds sirloin steaks (sliced 1/4" thick)
- 2 cups soy sauce
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 1 cup pineapple juice
- 2 tablespoons sriracha
- 2 tablespoons red pepper flake
- 2 tablespoons hoisin
- 2 teaspoons onion powder
- 2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
- 2 tablespoons minced garlic

## Instructions
1. Mix all marinade ingredients into a one-gallon zip-lock bag along with the sliced beef
2. Seal bag, remove air. Refrigerate 6-24 hours. Remove 1 hour before cooking.
3. Startup Traeger on smoke setting (180-190°F)
4. Lay out meat with 1/2 inch space between pieces
5. Smoke 4-5 hours, turning once at 2-2.5 hours
6. Cool 30-60 minutes before refrigerating

## Tips
- Choose leaner cuts (top sirloin, London broil, flank) - fattier cuts spoil faster
- Slice 1/4" thick, across the grain
- Watch edges for hot spots
- Never use liquid smoke when you have a real smoker
- Has good heat from sriracha/red pepper - reduce if needed
