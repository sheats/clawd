- **BullX** - Trading platform with lower fees (10% less than competitors)
- **Pump Vision** - Monitor new token deployments across platforms
- **Bubble Maps** - Check wallet connections for insider detection
- **DexScreener** - Paid version for additional insights

- Volume: min $100,000
- Market Cap: min $8,000
- Buys: min 5
- Token Age: min 5,000 mins

## Key Tips

### Finding Gems
- Follow Twitter for news/trends and current meta
- At time of thread: AI meta was hot ($GOAT, $ACT)
- Always check insider and dev holdings
- Use bubble maps to check wallet connections

### Social Verification
- Tokens without socials = usually bad sign
- High volume can override lack of socials
- Check original Pump.fun page for hype indicators
- Paid DexScreener badge = small positive signal

### Buying Strategy
- Wait for good entry points and dips
- Don't FOMO into tokens that already pumped
- Memes work like altcoins but with smaller market caps

### Trading Presets (BullX)
Keep 2-3 presets ready:
1. **Normal**: 1-3% slippage, no tips
2. **Fast/Hype**: Higher slippage + validator tips (for hot tokens)

⚠️ **Always use MEV protection** - or you'll get sandwiched and lose profit immediately

### Mindset
- Won't make huge profits overnight
- Expect to lose some money while gaining experience
- Experiment with different filters and market cap ranges
