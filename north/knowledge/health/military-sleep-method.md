## Why It Matters

- People who sleep less than 7 hours are **19% less productive**
- Sleeping only 6 hours has a similar effect on your brain as **drinking 2 beers**

## The Technique

From "Relax and Win: Championship Performance" by Lloyd Bud Winter — taught to US Navy pilots.

### Step 1: Relax Your Entire Face
- Close your eyes
- Breathe slowly and deeply
- Scan down your face, starting with your forehead
- Release tension (especially in your jaw)

### Step 2: Drop Your Shoulders and Arms
- Relax your neck
- Relax your traps
- Let shoulders pull down naturally
- Scan each arm: bicep → forearm → hands → fingers

### Step 3: Relax Your Chest and Stomach
- With each breath, let your chest relax more
- Feel each inhale down into your stomach
- Everything should be softening

### Step 4: Relax Your Legs
- Scan down through your legs
- Thighs → calves → ankles → toes
- Let each leg sink into the bed

### Step 5: Clear Your Mind
- Hold a calming image:
  - A still lake surrounded by mountains
  - Ocean waves on a beach
- Or count your breaths

## Important Note

This technique worked for **96% of pilots after 6 weeks** of practice. Be patient — results take time.
