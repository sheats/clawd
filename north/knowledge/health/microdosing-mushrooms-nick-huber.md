*Source: @sweatystartup (Nick Huber) on X, August 2025*

## Nick's Experience (2 months)

"Haven't felt anything. Except better mood, more excited and playful with my kids, more improvements in golf game, clearer head."

## Protocol

- **Strain**: Penis Envy
- **Dose**: 100mg
- **Frequency**: 1x every 3 days
- **Timing**: Morning only (sleep issues if taken later)
- **Duration**: Ongoing

## Setup

Working with a "medicine woman" in Boulder, Colorado:
- Guided program with 4 Zoom calls (90 min each, 2 weeks apart)
- She provides pills and guidance on dosing, what to watch out for
- Also teaches breathwork

## Effects on Dosing Days

- Forget you took it
- End up being productive
- Good mood
- More aware of body
- Colors maybe a bit brighter
- Maybe a little more spiritual

## The Science (per @hubermanlab)

Increases in serotonin, ACh, dopamine, or norepinephrine can predictably increase sensory plasticity. It's about neuromodulation generally, not a specific neuromodulator.

## Benefits Nick Attributes to Practice

- Neuroplasticity - opens mind, helps break habits, learn things
- Prevents getting set in your ways
- More present and aware of surroundings, nature, place in it all
- Better emotional regulation
- Breathwork: clearer head, more focused, less anxious

## The House Metaphor (Emotional Regulation)

- **Roof**: Amped up (anxious, scared, angry, stressed)
- **Main level**: Even and reliable (joy, happiness, contentment)
- **Basement**: Sadness, depression, grouchiness

**Goal**: Widen and strengthen nervous system to spend more time on main level. Less moody, less anger. Strong, dependable, even keel.

## Deeper Work (Not for Everyone)

Guide also offers "hero's doses" - 3 gram sessions (30x microdose):
- Takes ~5 hours
- People come out and stop drinking, cure PTSD, find Jesus, change as a person

Nick: "It scares me a bit to think about changing as a person... But I'm a supporter generally for people going through trauma, addiction, or grieving."

## Breathwork App

Nick uses **Othership** app:
- During sauna
- Mid-day
- Before sleep
- Not just on dosing days

## Insightful Comment from Thread

> "This guy isn't describing microdosing. He's describing subconscious recalibration of his nervous system. The mushrooms aren't giving him new experiences - they're stripping away accumulated static so he can actually feel baseline reality again."

Psychedelics at micro-dose levels don't ADD anything - they REMOVE blockages. They soften grooves of rigid habit loops and create micro-flexibility in brain wiring.

## Caveat

"If you have an obsessive or addictive personality I'd stay away."
