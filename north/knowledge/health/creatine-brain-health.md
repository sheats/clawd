## Key Finding

Increased brain creatine levels may function as a **buffer to metabolic stress** leading to neurological benefits.

**Important:** Doses >5g/day are likely required for brain benefits.

> "5 grams of creatine per day saturates your muscles, but is likely too low for the brain."

## Reframing Creatine

For years creatine has been framed as a muscle supplement. In reality, creatine is a **cellular energy buffer**—and the brain is one of the most energy-demanding organs we have.

This helps explain why effects show up most clearly during stressors:
- Mental fatigue
- Aging
- Neurological strain

**Creatine for the brain is about giving neurons more margin before they fail.**

## Special Populations

**Vegetarians and vegans see the most dramatic cognitive boost.** Since they have lower baseline creatine stores from diet, supplementation produces a larger relative increase in brain creatine. They experience more pronounced improvements in:
- Memory
- Processing speed

## Mental Health Connection

Creatine + therapy or antidepressant leads to greater response (separate review also published).

## Practical Notes

- **Brokerages for portfolio margin:** Schwab, E*Trade, Public
- **Dose for brain:** >5g/day (some research suggests up to 20-30g)
- **Side effects:** Some report brain fog or sleep issues; may not work for everyone
- **Quality:** Be careful with gummies or cheap brands—some have been found to contain zero actual creatine

## The Gym Bro Wisdom

> "The gym bros are always right." - @NTFabiano

> "Excited for this level of research to be conducted on other supplements. Can you imagine how much the gym bros were right about?" - @MetaMorpehus

**Bottom Line:** As cognitive load increases in modern life, buffering neural energy systems may become foundational. Consider creatine not just for muscles, but for brain resilience.
