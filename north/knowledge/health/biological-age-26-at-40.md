## 1. Get Stress Under Control

Too much cortisol makes your body age faster than your chronological age.

### Anti-Stress Protocol:
- No toxic people
- Sleep priority #1
- No phone 2 hours before or after bed
- Workout daily & intensely to release frustrations
- Breathing & walks to let go of things bothering you
- **Death walks** every morning

### Death Walks
Walk every morning contemplating death — that you soon will not be on this earth.

**Effect:** Gratitude, clarity, calm. Realize how insignificant you are (a speck in the universe).

## 2. Sleep On A Proper Schedule

Routine and WHEN you sleep matter as much as duration.

### Rules:
- No caffeine after 9 AM
- No workouts after 6 PM
- Target 8 hours uninterrupted

### Pre-Bed Priming Routine:
- No alcohol on weekdays
- Finish eating 3 hours before bed
- Stop emails/texts 2 hours before bed
- Hot tub 30 min, 3-4x per week
- Read most evenings

### Sleep Toolkit:
- MZOO sleep mask
- Flat, lightly stuffed pillow (or PillowCube)
- Eight Sleep cooling cover
- White noise machine (or Oak app)
- Room temp ~68°F (20°C)

## 3. Lift Heavy Weights, Increase Mobility, Less Cardio

Research shows regular exercise counterbalances aging effects.

**Optimize for:**
- Strength
- Stamina
- Mobility

Work out ~1 hour every day.

*Less cardio — focus on lifting heavy and mobility work.*
