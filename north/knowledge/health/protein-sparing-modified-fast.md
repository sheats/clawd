## The Claim

The fastest way to burn fat isn't intermittent fasting, keto, or carnivore.

Research shows a method that can help you lose **7 to 15 pounds of fat in 14 days** without losing muscle.

It's called the **Protein Sparing Modified Fast (PSMF)**.

---

## Key Principles

PSMF is a very low-calorie diet that emphasizes:
- **High protein intake** to preserve muscle mass
- **Minimal fat and carbs** to maximize fat burning
- **Short duration** (typically 2 weeks)

The "protein sparing" aspect refers to eating enough protein that your body burns fat for energy instead of breaking down muscle tissue.

---

## Typical Protocol

- **Protein:** 1g per pound of lean body mass (or target weight)
- **Calories:** Very low (typically 800-1200 total)
- **Carbs:** Minimal, mostly from vegetables
- **Fats:** Minimal, only what comes with protein sources

---

## Duration

- Short-term protocol: **2 weeks**
- Not meant for long-term use
- Often used as a "kickstart" or for rapid fat loss before an event

---

## Important Notes

- This is an aggressive approach requiring proper execution
- Supplementation often recommended (electrolytes, multivitamins)
- Not suitable for everyone
- Consult healthcare provider before attempting
- Refeeds may be incorporated for longer protocols
