## Overview

Tyler Denk, cofounder/CEO of beehiiv, shared the exact playbook they used in the early days to grow from zero to $2M MRR.

## The 10 Tactics

### 1. Build a Waitlist

First 100 customers came from a simple tweet.

**Goals:**
- Establish credibility
- Connect with potential users

### 2. Ship One Marketable Feature Every Week

This created FOMO and made the product feel alive.

**Key benefit:** Built the narrative that they could (and would) build anything to serve their users.

Perfected "product drops" to maximize hype.

### 3. Lean Into Your Key Differentiator

Tyler built the viral referral program at Morning Brew. Every newsletter tried to copy it.

**beehiiv's move:** Gave the referral program to every user for free—none of their competitors offered this.

### 4. Scalability is Overrated

Their first "security system" was just a Google form.

**Results:**
- Saved months of dev work
- Became a growth hack—Tyler messaged every single new user (20K+ of them)

> "Where others saw 'unscalable' I saw 'opportunity'"

### 5. Don't Make People Think

All competitors had complex pricing based on list size and emails sent.

**beehiiv's approach:** All-inclusive plan for $99/mo. No friction. Super simple to communicate.

### 6. Make the Product Inherently Viral

Product-led growth is a superpower (Hotmail was the OG example).

**beehiiv's version:**
- Badge in email footer
- Badge on websites
- Shareable dashboards
- Badges, milestones, recaps

### 7. Raise from Strategic Angels

Most founders chase clout and tier 1 VCs.

**Tyler's approach:** Chased strategic angels who would actually use the product.

**Benefit:** Early credibility and case studies to win more customers.

### 8. Everyone is Distribution

Entire team is active on socials (it's a cheat code).

**System:**
- Dedicated Slack channel to share posts to promote
- Best posts are from users having success

### 9. Don't Sleep on LinkedIn

LinkedIn is the highest ROI platform for generating new business.

**Tyler's system:**
- Message every single person who engaged with content
- Some were dead-ends, others became enterprise users
- Scaled this: now exports leads to sales team

### 10. Write Monthly Investor Updates

Even if you don't have any investors!

**Benefits:**
- Holds you accountable
- Forces you to communicate priorities
- Keeps you top of mind

> "It's the highest leverage thing I do each month"
