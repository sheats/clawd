ChatGPT is experimenting with advertising in their free subscription.

## The Pattern

I'm old enough to remember when Google started running ads and for a few years you could get warm leads for pennies.

I also remember when Facebook launched ads and they had so many eyeballs and so few advertisers that it cost nothing to get clients for the first few years.

## Why Corporate Advertisers Are Slow

Corporate advertisers don't move fast on new things:
- They take 6 months to plan
- And 6 months to test before they go in heavy

## The Opportunity

Right now ChatGPT has **almost a billion users a week.**

If they start running ads, they will have:
- A lot of eyeballs
- Not so many advertisers (until the corporates come in)

**There will be a window of opportunity to win customers very cheaply if you jump on it.**

## The Regret

I wish I had been more bullish when Google and Facebook launched ads. I didn't recognise how unique the moment was and I also didn't realise how fleeting it would be.

## The Lesson

When ChatGPT launches ads, I'm going to seize the day and I'd encourage you to be ready to do the same.
