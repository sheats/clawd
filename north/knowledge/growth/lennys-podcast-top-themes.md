Compelling narratives align organizations better than documents.

### 3. Positioning Is Strategy, Not Marketing
April Dunford's 5-step framework that starts with competitive alternatives, not messaging.

Shreyas Doshi's LNO Framework (Leverage/Neutral/Overhead) and focusing on **opportunity cost over ROI**.

### 6. AI is Transforming Product Development
Model maximalism, evals as core PM skill, CEOs becoming ICs again.

### 7. Empowered Teams vs. Feature Factories

## The 10 Most Counterintuitive Truths

### 1. Fear Gives Bad Advice—Do the Opposite
Whatever you're afraid to do (hard conversation, telling the board bad news) is exactly what you should do.

### 2. Adding Friction Can INCREASE Conversion
Adding personalization questions to signup improved Amplitude's conversion by 5%.

### 3. Fewer Features = More Value
The Walkman succeeded because Sony REMOVED recording. QuickBooks wins with half the features at double the price.

### 4. Adding People Makes You Slower (Absolutely)
Companies produce MORE total output after layoffs. Coordination overhead is the silent killer.

### 5. What Customers Say They Want Is Meaningless
93% said they wanted energy-efficient homes. Nobody bought them. **"Bitchin' ain't switchin'."**

### 6. Goals Are Not Strategy—They're the Opposite
Richard Rumelt says confusing goals for strategy is the most common strategic error. OKRs are often just wish lists.

### 7. Don't A/B Test Your Big Bets
Instagram and Airbnb actively reject testing for transformational changes. **You can't A/B test your way to greatness.**

### 8. Your Gut IS Data
Intuition is compressed experiential learning that isn't statistically significant yet. Don't discount it.

### 9. By the Time You're Thinking About Quitting, It's Too Late
Stewart Butterfield killed Glitch while it was still growing 6-7% weekly. That's why he could start Slack.

### 10. Most PMs Are Overpaid and Unnecessary
Marty Cagan himself says feature teams don't need PMs. Nikita Bier calls PM "not real."
