## The Pattern

Every new AI hire starts with these files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| IDENTITY.md | Who they are |
| USER.md | Who you are and your preferences |
| SOUL.md | Their tone and boundaries |
| AGENTS.md | Their operating rules |

## Key Insight

> "Just like a real employee, they need context about themselves AND about you."

> "The clearer you define this up front, the less you micromanage later."

## Note

This is exactly how Peter's setup with North works. Good validation of the pattern.
