# Claude Code as Teacher (FOR[yourname].md)

## The Pattern

Add to CLAUDE.md:

> "For every project, write a detailed FOR[yourname].md file that explains the whole project in plain language."

## Why It Works

Most engineers using Claude Code are **shipping faster while learning slower**:
- Get working code
- Merge PR
- Move to next ticket
- But reasoning is gone, bugs never internalized, patterns unexplained

This hack forces AI to teach you what it just did:
- Technical architecture
- The "why" behind technology choices
- Bugs and how they got fixed

## Result

Documentation that compounds. Six months later = personal engineering wiki written by an expert tutor who watched you build everything.

> "The engineers who figure this out will learn 3x faster than their peers running the same tools."
