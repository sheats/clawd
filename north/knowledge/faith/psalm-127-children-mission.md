I wasted 6 years building something God never asked me to build.

70-hour weeks.

Marriage on fumes.

Kids growing up without me.

A "career" that meant nothing.

Then I read Psalm 127 in the cab of my garbage truck.

> "Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain."

Read that again, slowly. 

## Truth #1: Your hustle means nothing without God's direction.

"They labour in vain."

Vain. Empty. Pointless.
You can build a tower God never commissioned.

## Truth #2: Most men aren't led. They're self-employed.

They call it "drive." It's self-worship.

## Truth #3: Anxiety is a sign you're carrying what God should carry.

> "It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows…"

That's not "discipline."
That's self-reliance pretending to be virtue.
God gives His beloved sleep.

## Truth #4: Children are not interruptions to your mission. They are your mission.

> "Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the womb is his reward."

The world calls them burdens.
God calls them reward.

## Truth #5: Your children are weapons, not trophies.

> "As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth."

You don't display arrows.
You sharpen them. Aim them. Launch them.

## Truth #6: A full quiver beats a full bank account.

> "Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them…"

## Truth #7: Your children will fight battles you'll never see.

> "They shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate."

The gate is where the public fights happen.
Your job is to prepare them to stand there.

**Action:** Get alone with Psalm 127 and write down the one thing you're building that God never asked you to build. Then start dismantling it.

You're building a house right now. Every day.

In your marriage.
In your household.
In your conscience.
