## Key Takeaways

From Cernovich's advice for business owners:

> "And if you set up a company, even if you don't think you're going to sell it. Please, for the love of all that is holy, look up C-Corp and QSBS."

### Three things to research:
1. **C-Corp and QSBS** (Qualified Small Business Stock) - major tax benefits if you sell
2. **SEP IRA** - self-employed retirement with high contribution limits
3. **Defined Benefits Programs** - another retirement strategy

## What is QSBS?

QSBS (Qualified Small Business Stock) allows founders/early investors to potentially exclude up to **$10 million in capital gains** (or 10x cost basis) from federal taxes when selling C-Corp stock, if held 5+ years and other requirements are met.

## Why This Matters

Even if you don't plan to sell your company, structuring as a C-Corp from the start preserves optionality for QSBS treatment later. Restructuring later is much harder.
