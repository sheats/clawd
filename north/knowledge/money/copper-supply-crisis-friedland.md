## The Math

- **Current consumption:** 30 million tonnes of copper per year
- **Recycled:** Only 4 million tonnes (13%)
- **Gap:** 26 million tonnes must be mined annually

## The Stunning Claim

> "To maintain 3% GDP growth, with no electrification, we have to mine the same amount of copper in the next 18 years as we mined in the last 10,000 years, combined."

And that's **before** factoring in:
- EV transition
- Data centers
- Solar and wind buildout
- General grid expansion

## Thread Commentary

### Bull Case
> "The future isn't about higher prices because demand is strong. It's about prices needing to rise just to force supply to exist. Most people still think copper is cyclical. They don't realise it's becoming strategic, like energy or food." - @rohantantia

### Interesting Angle
> "Most people don't get it - but this is why landfills will become the most profitable 'mines' over the next several years." - @TylerTaggart1 (Super long $WM)

### Counter-View
> "Human ingenuity always wins. Raw material cost is in an inverse relationship to the probability of finding alternatives. The more expensive something gets, the more incentive to look for alternatives." - @n13

### Skepticism
> "Serious, large-scale, industrial copper mining has only existed for maybe 150-250 years tops and 95% of all copper mined was mined in the 1900's." - @ITrudge_o7

## Key Insight

**Copper isn't cyclical anymore—it's strategic.** The supply response has been painfully slow while demand keeps accelerating. This isn't a trade. It's a long, uncomfortable adjustment where the world discovers that growth has material limits—and copper sits right at that choke point.

**Investment implication:** Even finding an alternative would take years to prove the process and change the entire supply chain. The structural deficit isn't going away soon.
