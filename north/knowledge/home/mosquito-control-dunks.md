## The Solution

**Mosquito Dunks** — poison for mosquito larvae

Nat spent thousands on professional mosquito treatments over the years with no noticeable difference. These dunks reduced mosquitos ~90% within a couple weeks.

## How It Works

1. Create patches of standing water around your property
2. Put dunks in the water
3. Mosquitos are attracted to lay eggs in the standing water
4. The dunks kill all the offspring

## Pro Tips

### Bait Bucket Method (from @JakeKeuhlen)
- Set up a 5-gallon bucket in the garden
- Add mud, sticks, leaves, and water
- Toss in a new dunk every couple months
- Leave it all summer

### Dragonfly Perches (from @BrunoPresents)
- Put 36-inch stilt poles around the area
- Dragonflies need perches to hunt
- They eat ~1,000 mosquitos per day each
- Can use bamboo sticks or clotheslines

## FAQ

**How long does each dunk last?**
About a month

**What if there's no standing water on property?**
