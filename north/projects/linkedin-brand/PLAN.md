# LinkedIn Personal Brand: Peter Sheats

*Building a CTO/VP Engineering thought leadership presence*

**Created:** 2026-01-25
**Status:** Phase 1 — Information Gathering

---

## The Goal

Transform Peter from "great recommendations but invisible" to "the CTO people want to hire and learn from."

**Current State:**
- 500+ connections, 813 followers
- Zero posts, zero impressions
- Incredible background: ClearCare (0→4,000 agencies), Activated Insights, Home Care Pulse
- Recommendations call him "force of nature" and "legend"

**Target State:**
- Consistent posting presence (3x/week)
- Recognized voice in engineering leadership
- Inbound opportunities (roles, advisory, speaking)
- Network effect: people share and engage with his content

## The Strategy

### Why This Approach

From [Alex Nguyen's 100-Day LinkedIn Challenge](https://realalexnguyen.medium.com/i-wrote-on-linkedin-for-100-days-now-i-never-have-to-worry-about-finding-a-job-bf785d00341c):
> "The best way to do something is to tell everyone else about it. The social peer pressure helps."

**Peter's blockers:**
1. Decision paralysis — "What should I post?"
2. Self-promotion aversion — "I don't want to brag"
3. Perfectionism — Waiting for the perfect post

**Our solution:**
- Remove decision fatigue by extracting content FROM Peter via questions
- Reframe: Teaching, not bragging. Your failures and lessons help others.
- Lower the bar: Progress over perfection

---

## Trend Monitoring (Ongoing)

**Purpose:** Surface timely topics Peter can react to — not just evergreen content.

**What we track:**
- **X/Twitter**: Tech leadership, engineering culture, startup discourse
- **Hacker News**: Top stories in tech/startups
- **Key voices**: Follow what influential CTOs/VPs are posting
- **News**: Layoffs, AI shifts, funding rounds, industry moves

**Delivery:**
- 3x/week alongside question sessions
- Format: "Here's what people are talking about this week — any hot takes?"
- Peter can react to 1-2 topics or skip entirely

**Sources:**
- `bird search "engineering leadership"` / `"CTO"` / `"VP engineering"`
- HN front page via API
- Curated list of voices to monitor (build over time)

**Reactive Content Types:**
1. **Hot take** — Quick opinion on news (layoffs, AI tools, etc.)
2. **"Here's what people miss..."** — Contrarian response to trending topic
3. **Experience-based commentary** — "I dealt with this at ClearCare, here's what I learned"
4. **Signal boost + add value** — Share someone else's post with your perspective

---

## Phase 1: Information Gathering (Weeks 1-3)

**Format:** 3x per week, North sends 10 questions + trend digest. Peter voice-dictates answers.

**Goal:** Build a rich repository of Peter's stories, lessons, opinions, and experiences that we can later synthesize into posts.

### Question Categories

1. **War Stories** — Specific moments, decisions, turning points
2. **Lessons Learned** — What you'd tell your younger self
3. **Opinions** — Hot takes on tech, leadership, startups
4. **Frameworks** — How you think about problems
5. **People** — Mentors, team members, pivotal relationships
6. **Failures** — What went wrong and what you learned
7. **Wins** — Achievements (framed as lessons)
8. **Advice** — What you tell founders/engineers who ask
9. **Industry Takes** — Trends, predictions, observations
10. **Personal** — Values, faith, family (where appropriate)

### Schedule

| Week | Sessions | Dates |
|------|----------|-------|
| Week 1 | Mon, Wed, Fri | Jan 27, 29, 31 |
| Week 2 | Mon, Wed, Fri | Feb 3, 5, 7 |
| Week 3 | Mon, Wed, Fri | Feb 10, 12, 14 |

**Total:** 9 sessions × 10 questions = 90 answered questions

4. What's your philosophy on engineering culture?
5. How do you balance speed vs. quality when you're growing fast?

## Phase 2: Content Synthesis (Weeks 4-6)

After gathering raw material, North will:

1. **Analyze themes** — What stories/lessons repeat? What's uniquely Peter?
2. **Draft posts** — Turn answers into LinkedIn-ready content
3. **Create content calendar** — Mix of formats (stories, lessons, hot takes, frameworks)
4. **Review cycle** — Peter approves/edits before posting

### Content Formats

Based on what works on LinkedIn:

1. **Personal Story + Lesson** (highest engagement)
   > "In 2012, I made a decision that changed my career..."

2. **Contrarian Take**
   > "Unpopular opinion: Code reviews are overrated. Here's why..."

3. **Framework/List**
   > "5 things I look for when hiring senior engineers"

4. **Failure Story**
   > "I got fired once. Here's what I learned..."

5. **Advice Post**
   > "A junior engineer asked me how to get promoted. Here's what I told them..."

6. **Industry Observation**
   > "I've been building software for 15+ years. Here's what's actually changed..."

---

## Phase 3: Publishing (Week 7+)

**Cadence:** 3x per week (Mon, Wed, Fri)

**Process:**
1. North drafts post from gathered material
2. Peter reviews and edits (voice or text)
3. North finalizes
4. Peter posts (or North helps automate)
5. Track engagement, iterate

## Best Practices (From Research)

### What Works on LinkedIn

1. **First line is everything** — Hook in 1-2 lines (before "see more")
2. **White space** — Short paragraphs, line breaks
3. **Personal > corporate** — People follow people, not brands
4. **Vulnerability wins** — Failures and lessons outperform brags
5. **End with engagement** — Question or call to action
6. **Consistency > virality** — Show up regularly
7. **Comment on others** — 10 thoughtful comments = 1 post in visibility

### What Successful Tech Leaders Do

- **Sahil Bloom**: Frameworks + personal stories
- **Lenny Rachitsky**: Deep expertise + generosity with knowledge  
- **Julie Zhuo**: Design leadership + vulnerability about failures
- **Will Larson**: Engineering management wisdom + book excerpts

**Common thread:** They teach from experience. They're not selling—they're sharing.

### Influencer Research (see `/research/influencer-strategies.md`)

**Dickie Bush** (Ship 30 for 30):
> "LinkedIn generates 70% of our leads and 70% of our revenue."
- 1 post/day on LinkedIn
- Don't start a blog, write on social instead
- 365 days of publishing = breakthrough

**Matt Gray** (850K+ audience):
> "Volume is everything. Consistency compounds."
- Posts LinkedIn 7 days/week at 8:07 AM EST
- "Think of content like a TV show"
- One idea → 20+ posts via repurposing

**Sahil Bloom**:
> "Wrong question: 'How do I build a personal brand?' Right question: 'How do I create value for others?'"
- 30 minutes/day for 30 days = momentum
- Focus on value, brand is the byproduct

### Peter's Unique Angle

- **Scale story**: First dev → VP Engineering at ClearCare (0→4,000 agencies)
- **Hands-on leader**: Still codes, still builds, not just "strategy"
- **Multiple chapters**: ClearCare → Activated Insights → Home Care Pulse → ReturnZap
- **Real stakes**: Family man, business owner, faith-driven
