### Professional Background

- **Cofounder, Technology at Activated Insights** (Sep 2017 - Dec 2022, 5+ years)
- **VP Engineering, ClearCare** (2011 - 2017, 6 years) — first dev, scaled 0 → 4,000 agencies
- Called a "force of nature" and "legend" in recommendations

## Key Insights

### Why Peter doesn't post on LinkedIn
- Decision paralysis
- Feels awkward / doesn't like self-promotion  
- Shame about past content
- Reframe: posting is teaching, not bragging. His experience helps others.

### What's blocking High Cotton
- Neither Peter nor wife has bandwidth to execute
- Peter focused on ReturnZap
- Wife busy with kids (especially 1-year-old), less e-commerce experience
- Strategy exists, platform exists — **execution gap**, not planning gap
- Deployment migration 90% done — just needs cron jobs configured

### Working style
- Likes GitHub: PRs, issues, kanban boards
- Wants daily clarity on "highest leverage thing to do"
- Struggles with decision paralysis
- Needs someone to say "do this today" not "here are 10 options"

## 90-Day Priorities (Jan–Apr 2026)

1. **ReturnZap** — Revenue growth (sales + dev momentum)
2. **High Cotton** — Digital marketing strategy that moves product
3. **North system** — Use AI to quiet noise, focus, compound impact

**Parked:** LinkedIn personal brand, investment businesses

## Important Files

- `/Users/sheats/clawd/MASTER_PLAN.md` — Life operating system (10 areas: family, faith, health, business, career, money, growth, home, freedom)
- `/Users/sheats/clawd/memory/strategies/x-bookmarks.md` — X bookmark processing strategy
- `/Users/sheats/hc/` — High Cotton monorepo (Django + React + Shopify + strategy docs)
- `/Users/sheats/hc/strategy/` — Comprehensive strategy hub (marketing, SEO, brand, etc.)
- `/Users/sheats/hc/strategy/infrastructure/architect.md` — Migration plan with code for cron jobs

## Active Systems (In Progress)

### X Bookmarks → Knowledge Base ✅
- **Goal:** Daily task processes X bookmarks, extracts full thread content, categorizes by MASTER_PLAN areas, stores for later retrieval
- **Status:** LIVE — cron job runs daily at 6 AM
- **Location:** `knowledge/` organized by MASTER_PLAN categories
- **Why:** North can reference saved content during brainstorming, find things on demand

### Voice Calls with North
- **Goal:** Real phone calls for walking conversations
- **Status:** Exploring Clawdbot voice-call plugin (Twilio/Telnyx)
- **Needs:** Phone number, API keys, webhook/tunnel setup

## Lessons Learned

### How Peter Consumes Content
- **Context-driven, not backlog-driven** — He won't read 7 articles "because they're good"
- **Relevance to current focus** — Content must connect to what he's actively working on
- **Just-in-time surfacing** — When he's working on productivity, THEN suggest the productivity content
- **Don't assign reading homework** — Instead, surface relevant saved content when the moment is right

**How to apply:**
- Don't dump reading lists on him
- When he's working on X, search knowledge base for X-related content and suggest 1-2 pieces
- Frame as "You saved this a while back, relevant now" not "Read these 7 things"

### Daily Structure (Business Days)
- **Top priority:** 7-8 hours coding on ReturnZap — this is THE focus
- **Morning buffer:** 15 minutes max for catching up, investing in other things
- **Hard to get started:** Don't pile on morning tasks that delay deep work
- **Unscheduled todos are fine:** Keep a list of "other things" without specific times
- **Don't over-schedule:** Minimal time blocks, protect the coding time

**How to apply:**
- Morning: ONE 15-min block for quick wins (inbox, review, admin)
- Then: "Deep work: ReturnZap" as the main event (unscheduled or loose block)
- Unscheduled todos: Things like LinkedIn, High Cotton, other projects — no pressure on timing
- Don't create friction that delays getting into code
