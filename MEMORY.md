## Key Insights

### Why Peter doesn't post on LinkedIn
- Decision paralysis
- Feels awkward / doesn't like self-promotion  
- Shame about past content
- Reframe: posting is teaching, not bragging. His experience helps others.

### What's blocking High Cotton
- Neither Peter nor wife has bandwidth to execute
- Peter focused on ReturnZap
- Wife busy with kids (especially 1-year-old), less e-commerce experience
- Strategy exists, platform exists — **execution gap**, not planning gap
- Deployment migration 90% done — just needs cron jobs configured

### Working style
- Likes GitHub: PRs, issues, kanban boards
- Wants daily clarity on "highest leverage thing to do"
- Struggles with decision paralysis
- Needs someone to say "do this today" not "here are 10 options"

## 90-Day Priorities (Jan–Apr 2026)

1. **ReturnZap** — Revenue growth (sales + dev momentum)
2. **High Cotton** — Digital marketing strategy that moves product
3. **North system** — Use AI to quiet noise, focus, compound impact

**Parked:** LinkedIn personal brand, investment businesses

- **Goal:** Daily task processes X bookmarks, extracts full thread content, categorizes by MASTER_PLAN areas, stores for later retrieval
- **Status:** Strategy documented, need to set up bird CLI auth + cron job
- **Why:** So North can reference saved content during brainstorming, find things on demand
