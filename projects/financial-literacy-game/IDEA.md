# Financial Literacy Game — Idea Capture

*Captured: January 28, 2026*

## The Problem

- High schools and colleges don't teach financial literacy
- College kids get credit cards, rack up debt, stumble through financial decisions
- Nobody teaches: leasing vs buying, rent vs own, term vs whole life insurance, investing basics, credit management

---

## The Idea

**A turn-based mobile game where you simulate life from age 18 to 90, making financial and life decisions each month.**

### Core Mechanics

- **One turn = one month** of life
- Start at age 18
- Make decisions, see consequences compound over time
- Play a "full life" in one session
- See where you end up at 90

### Decision Categories

**Education & Career:**
- College (and debt) vs trade school vs straight to work
- Part-time jobs, summer jobs
- Side hustles (YouTube channel, etc.)
- Career progression

**Financial Decisions:**
- Investing in stock market
- Silver/gold
- (Maybe no crypto initially — too easy/volatile)
- Credit card management
- Debt decisions

**Big Purchases:**
- Rent vs buy housing
- Lease vs buy car
- How much house/car to afford

**Insurance & Protection:**
- Term vs whole life insurance (whole life = trap)
- Health insurance
- Emergency fund

**Life Events:**
- Marriage (costs money, changes time)
- Kids (costs money, takes time)
- Health (neglect it and suffer consequences)

### Constraints & Tradeoffs

- **Time is limited** — can't do everything
- Having kids/marriage takes time away from career/hustle
- Health suffers if neglected
- Decisions compound over decades

### Scoring Dimensions

Multiple "currencies" to optimize:
- **Wealth** — net worth, passive income
- **Health** — physical/mental wellbeing
- **Relationships** — family, marriage, social
- **Social Capital** — network, reputation
- **Influence/Power** — career success, impact

---

## Platform & Distribution

**Phase 1:**
- iOS mobile game (iPhone first)
- Single player
- Simple mechanics, can dig deeper

**Phase 2:**
- Multiplayer — play against friends
- Leaderboards, challenges
- Compare life outcomes

**Phase 3:**
- B2B — sell to schools, high schools, colleges
- Financial literacy curriculum integration

---

## Marketing/Audience Building

- TikTok and YouTube content
- Theme: "You don't know what you're doing. You weren't taught this. We'll teach you."
- Bite-sized videos about financial decisions
- Build audience first, then launch game to them

---

## Unique Angles

- **Each game simulates different economic conditions** — stock market, inflation, etc. are procedurally generated so no two games are identical
- **Learn by playing multiple times** — different strategies, different outcomes
- **Scott Adams "how to hack your life" inspiration** — systems thinking, life optimization
- **Game of Life meets financial education**

---

## Competition & Inspiration

- Other companies doing financial literacy content
- But not many doing: turn-based, mobile-friendly, play-with-friends, simulate-whole-life
- The "game" wrapper makes it sticky and replayable

---

## Open Questions

- Monetization: Free with ads? Premium? Freemium?
- How deep do the mechanics go? Simple vs simulation-heavy?
- What's the MVP? (Maybe just 18-30 with core decisions?)
- Art style? (Simple/clean vs illustrated vs pixel?)
- Name?

---

## Next Steps (When Ready)

1. Competitive research — what exists?
2. MVP scope — what's the smallest playable version?
3. Tech stack — React Native? Unity? SwiftUI?
4. Content partnership — financial literacy influencers?
