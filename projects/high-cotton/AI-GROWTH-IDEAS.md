# High Cotton — AI-Powered Growth Ideas

*Brain dump captured: January 28, 2026*

**Current state:** ~$400K in sales (neckties, bow ties, cummerbunds)
**Vision:** Become the next Southern Tide / Vineyard Vines — all online, AI-powered

## Operational Decisions

### 3PL (Third-Party Logistics)
- Peter wants to move to 3PL
- Amanda is hesitant
- Still looking for the right partner

### Automation Priorities
1. Inventory management
2. Back office operations
3. Customer service (AI-powered)
4. Foundation systems for scale

### Amanda's Role
- Currently: sends out emails
- Question: What's her strong suit? What should she focus on?

## AI-Powered Marketing Ideas

### 1. Personalized Email Marketing
**Problem:** Why are we still sending mass emails?

**Vision:** AI agent that:
- Looks at order history of each subscriber
- Tailors emails individually to each person
- Recommends products based on their purchase patterns

### 2. Social Media White Glove Service
**Idea:** Build a customer database + do personalized outreach

- Interact with followers on Facebook/Instagram directly
- Send friendly DMs (not spammy)
- Look at their posts, offer fashion tips
- Build relationships, not just transactions
- "Why pay services to do this when we can build it ourselves?"

### 3. AI Style Recommendations
**Inspiration:** Stitch Fix-style service Peter used before

**Vision:**
- Customer uploads photos (or we look at their social media)
- AI recommends products that match their style
- Start with ties, expand to full accessories
- Personalized shopping experience

## Product Expansion Ideas

### Accessories Line
- Belts
- Other men's accessories
- Become a full accessories brand

### Baby Clothes Line
- Leverage the "High Cotton" southern brand
- Baby/kids market

### Women's Line
- "Women shop more than men"
- High Cotton Women's collection
- Could significantly expand TAM

## Growth Strategy

### Current Problem
- Paying ~30% to Google Ads to acquire customers
- Not sustainable at scale

### Desired State
- Find organic traffic opportunities
- Reduce paid acquisition dependency
- Once someone is a customer, do MUCH better at:
  - Tailored marketing
  - Personalized messaging
  - Repeat purchases
  - Lifetime value optimization

### The Southern Tide Question
How do you go from $400K → Southern Tide scale using AI?
- No physical stores (for now)
- AI for marketing, messaging, personalization
- Find organic channels
- Build brand, not just transactions
