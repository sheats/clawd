## Key Insights (from recent tweets)

### On Goals & Execution
> "Grab a notebook. Write out exactly what you want in your future, don't miss a detail. Then, break it down into goals. Decades, years, months, weeks, and days. Every day, write down the 3 levers you can pull to make actual progress. Then, forget about the goals and execute."

### On Focus
> "You don't magically become focused. You practice it. You notice you're distracted and snap out of it, over and over again until it's second nature."

> "The greatest focus hack is to know what you're working on, why you're working on it, when it needs to be done, and how exactly to get it done."

### On Self-Promotion
> "If you don't shamelessly promote your work, every day for the next 2-3 years, you will get stuck doing someone else's work until you realize that nobody is going to pay you if they have no idea who you are."

### On Long-Form Content
> "The pendulum swung too far in the direction of TikTok and endless scrolling and the internet has a chance to self-correct. Long form content allows you to focus on set of ideas. It brings order to the mind. You learn more, you feel better..."

> "A bullet list of actionable steps will do absolutely nothing for you. You're completely missing the context that allows you to turn those tips into results."

### On Multiple Interests
> "If you have multiple interests, don't let anyone convince you that you should narrow your focus. You may be confused for a while, but if you stick it out, you will blow past everyone else."

### On Making Mistakes
> "The primary reason people don't achieve big goals is because they don't realize that the only source of truth is making mistakes. They soak up advice and theory, expecting it to be an exact match to their mind, experience, and situation just to fail once and give up completely."
