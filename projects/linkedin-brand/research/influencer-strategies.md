## Matt Gray (@matt_gray_)

**Background:** Built 850,000+ audience, 7-figure business using content

### Key Insights

> "LinkedIn becomes a growth machine when you stop posting randomly and start using a system."

**His Exact Schedule:**
- LinkedIn: 7 days/week at 8:07 AM EST
- X: Twice daily at 8:11 AM & 2:07 PM EST

**System Components:**
- One idea turns into 20+ high-leverage posts
- Engagement infographics make content instantly recognizable
- CTAs turn into email subscribers and sales conversations

**Key Quotes:**
> "Volume is everything. Consistency compounds."

> "Think of your content like a TV show. The way you build loyal followers is by reliably posting."

> "Pick 2 platforms to dominate. Start with LinkedIn & X - they're 'Grand Slam' platforms. They let you master copywriting first, which transfers everywhere else."

**Tools:** Uses Hypefury for X automation, manual posting for LinkedIn

## Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom)

**Background:** Former VC, built massive newsletter and social following

### Key Insights

> "Wrong question: 'How do I build a personal brand?'
> Right question: 'How do I create value for others with my content (education, entertainment, etc)?'
> Focus on the foundational thing if you want the outcome."

**His Advice:**
> "Trying to build a personal brand but unable to build momentum? Write or create content for 30 minutes per day for 30 straight days. I guarantee you'll make a dent."

**Key Takeaway:** Focus on value creation, not brand building. The brand is the byproduct.

## Alex Nguyen (100-Day Challenge)

**Background:** Introvert who committed to 100 days of LinkedIn posts

### Key Insights

## Common Patterns Across All

### 1. Consistency > Perfection
- Daily or near-daily posting
- Public accountability (numbering posts, streaks)
- "Just show up" mentality

### 2. System Over Randomness
- Same time every day
- Content repurposing (one idea → many posts)
- Treat it like a TV show schedule

### 3. Volume Matters
- More posts = more data = faster learning
- You can't optimize what you don't publish
- Compound effects take time

### 4. Platform Selection
- LinkedIn + X are "Grand Slam" platforms
- Master copywriting first (transfers to video later)
- LinkedIn has higher conversion, lower volume needed

### 5. Value > Self-Promotion
- Focus on teaching, not bragging
- "How do I create value for others?"
- Personal stories + lessons > accomplishments

### 6. Feedback Loops
- Listen to what resonates
- Double down on winners
- Stop blaming algorithms

## Application for Peter

**What this means for you:**

1. **Don't overthink timing/tactics** — Just start posting consistently
2. **3x/week is a good starting point** — Can increase to daily later
3. **LinkedIn is the right platform** — Higher conversion for professional opportunities
4. **Systems matter** — Question sessions → content bank → scheduled posts
5. **Public accountability helps** — Consider numbering posts or announcing the challenge
6. **Value-first mindset** — Your ClearCare story helps other CTOs, that's the frame
