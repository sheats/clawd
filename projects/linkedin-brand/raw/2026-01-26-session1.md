## Q1: What's the biggest production outage you've dealt with, and what did it teach you about incident response?

**Two incidents:**

### Thanksgiving 2013 — Database Loss
- Lost entire production database
- Spent all day reconstructing from backups
- **Lessons:**
  - Importance of reliable backup strategy
  - Redundancy matters
  - Be careful about making changes during holiday hours

### Kubernetes Namespace Deletion
- Two engineers accidentally deleted production namespace
- They were trying to solve an issue, instructions said "try this" but they didn't fully understand what they were doing
- Spent all night bringing it back up
- **Root cause of extended downtime:** Neglected Kubernetes node updates and Helm chart maintenance — kept hitting conflicts
- **Lessons:**
  - Keep infrastructure up to date
  - Understand before you execute
  - Technical debt in infra compounds during incidents

## Q2: Tell me about a time you had to ship something you knew wasn't ready. What happened?

*(pending)*

## Q3: What's something you believed early in your career that you now know is wrong?

**Three beliefs I had to unlearn:**

1. **"It's faster to skip tests"**
   - Believed writing tests slowed you down
   - Wrong — it eventually catches up to you
   - Technical debt compounds

2. **"The best code wins"**
   - Thought elegant, perfect code mattered most
   - Wrong — shipping and iterating beats elegant code nobody uses
   - MVP is better. Ship fast, learn, iterate.

3. **"I need to have the answer"**
   - Thought leaders needed to know everything
   - Wrong — leaders ask better questions, they don't need all answers
   - Your job is to unlock the team, not be the smartest person in the room

## Q4: What's the most expensive mistake you've made as an engineer or leader?

*(pending)*

## Q5: What's an unpopular opinion you have about hiring engineers?

**Several hot takes:**

1. **"Resumes don't matter"** — Side projects, GitHub, or a conversation tell you more

2. **"I'd rather hire someone laid off from a startup than from FAANG"** — Scrappiness > process-following

3. **"Don't hire senior engineers for early-stage startups"** — They over-engineer; you need scrappy generalists

4. **"Referrals are overrated"** — They just clone your existing team's blind spots

5. **"The best engineers are terrible interviewers"** — Interview skill ≠ job skill

6. **"Years of experience is meaningless"** — Someone with 2 focused years can beat 10 years of coasting

## Q6: What do most startups get wrong about technical debt?

**Not having a solid test foundation to support the inevitable refactoring you'll have to do.**

- You *will* need to refactor
- Without tests, refactoring is terrifying and error-prone
- Tech debt isn't the shortcuts you took — it's not having the safety net to fix them later

## Q7: How do you decide when to build vs buy vs integrate?

*(pending)*

## Q8: What's your framework for saying no to feature requests from stakeholders?

**Tie it to market analysis and willingness to pay.**

- Understand: how does this drive new sales?
- If it's not well-researched, if we can't demonstrate a customer is willing to pay for it — why are we doing it?
- "Show me the customer who wants this" is a fair ask
- Protects the team from building features that don't move the needle

## Q9: What's a technical decision you made that paid off way more than expected?

**Two big ones:**

1. **Using Kubernetes**
   - Eliminated infrastructure management headaches
   - Awesome platform to build on
   - Scaling, deploys, rollbacks all become predictable

2. **Using Django**
   - Found solid developers who knew it well
   - Created a solid framework for building production-ready software
   - Used it again and again across projects
   - Has the longevity you want from a framework — still going strong

## Q10: What's the best team you ever built, and what made it work?

*(pending)*
