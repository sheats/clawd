# Digital Info Product Business Plan
## Targeting Conservative Adults 50+
### Goal: $10k/month via Organic Traffic

---

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines a strategy to build a digital info product business targeting MAGA-aligned adults aged 50+. Based on market research, this demographic represents a substantial, underserved audience with high purchasing power, strong email engagement, and clear pain points around survival preparedness, health autonomy, and wealth protection.

**Bottom Line:** This is a viable path to $10k/month, but it requires patience (6-12 months to meaningful revenue), consistent content creation, and authentic engagement with the community. The market is proven—multiple competitors are doing $1M+/year in this space—but you'll need to carve out a specific angle.

**Recommended Niche:** Survival/Preparedness with a health autonomy angle (the "Home Doctor" meets "Lost Ways" intersection)

**Realistic Timeline to $10k/month:** 9-15 months

---

## Part 1: Demographic Deep-Dive

### Who They Are

**Demographics:**
- 85% of MAGA supporters are members of gun-rights groups
- ~60% are members of charities and pro-police organizations
- 62.7% white, non-Hispanic (but growing multi-ethnic)
- Median age of preppers specifically: 51-53 years old
- Truth Social users: ~2/3 are over age 55
- 69% male in prepper community (but female participation growing rapidly)

| "best water filter for survival" | Commercial | Medium |
| "natural remedies for [condition]" | Informational | Medium |

- Where the real money is made

**Lead Magnets That Work:**
1. **Checklists/Cheat Sheets**
   - "72-Hour Emergency Checklist"

   - "Prepper's Pantry Inventory Sheet"

2. **Mini-Guides**
   - "5 Things to Do Before the Next Blackout"
   - "Home Remedies Your Grandmother Used"
   - "Survival Skills Everyone Should Know"

3. **Video Trainings**
   - Free YouTube video → email for "full guide"
   - Webinar replay access

3. Day 2: Quick win / valuable tip
4. Day 3: More value + soft mention of product
5. Day 4-6: Value + case study/testimonial
6. Day 7: Main offer (tripwire product)
7. Day 8-10: Overcome objections, urgency
8. Day 11+: Nurture sequence, weekly newsletter

**List Growth Goals:**
- Month 1-3: 500-1,000 subscribers

### Strategy 4: Facebook Groups / Community

**Safe Approach:**

- Create your own group ONLY after you have content/list
- Focus on value, let people come to you

**What Works:**
- Answer questions helpfully

## Part 10: Honest Risk Assessment

### What Could Go Wrong

**1. Platform Risk**
- YouTube channel terminated (unlikely if not political)
- Facebook ad account banned (common)
- Email deliverability issues
- **Mitigation:** Own your email list, diversify platforms, stay within guidelines

**2. Market Saturation**
- More competitors entering space
- "Lost Ways" style products everywhere
- **Mitigation:** Build personal brand, focus on trust/relationship

**3. Audience Trust Issues**
- Seen as "just another marketer"
- Overpromising and underdelivering
- **Mitigation:** Underpromise, overdeliver, be authentic

**4. Burnout**
- Content creation is relentless
- 6+ months before meaningful revenue
- **Mitigation:** Realistic expectations, batch content, use AI assistance

**5. Regulatory Issues**
- Health claims → FTC problems
- Financial advice → SEC issues
- **Mitigation:** Stick to information/education, use disclaimers, avoid specific claims

**6. Reputational Risk**
- Associated with extreme content
- Political polarization affects business relationships
- **Mitigation:** Stay practical/helpful, avoid partisan ranting

### Unknowns

1. **Your actual interest level** — Will you stick with this for 12+ months?
2. **Content creation ability** — Can you produce consistent YouTube content?
3. **Market timing** — Political cycle affects demand (higher during Democrat administrations historically)
4. **Personal brand fit** — Do you want to be the "face" of this?

### Honest Assessment

**Probability of hitting $10k/month in 12 months:** 20-30%
**Probability of hitting $10k/month in 18 months:** 40-50%
**Probability of hitting $1k/month in 6 months:** 60-70%
**Probability of making $0 if you quit after 3 months:** 99%

This is a **real business** with real competition. It's not passive income—especially not at first. The market is proven, the audience is real, the money is there. But it requires consistent work and patience.

### The Bottom Line

This business model works. People are making real money in this space. The question isn't whether it's possible—it's whether you'll execute consistently for long enough to see results.

The audience is there. The demand is real. The competition is beatable with a more authentic, less fear-mongering approach.

**Recommended starting point:** Survival/Preparedness with health autonomy angle. Call it something like "Practical Preparedness" or "Heritage Skills" — positions you as helpful, not paranoid.
