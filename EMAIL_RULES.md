# EMAIL_RULES.md - Inbox Processing Rules

*Last updated: 2026-01-25*

## Philosophy

Peter doesn't use email for information/data consumption. Email is for **communication that requires action**. Everything else is noise.

---

## Rules

### 1. Newsletters & Subscriptions → Unsubscribe
- **Action:** Unsubscribe from everything
- **No dedicated inbox** — just cut the noise entirely
- **Exception:** If Peter explicitly says to keep one, whitelist it

### 2. Financial & Investment Emails → Label for Weekly Review
- **Action:** Label/star these but don't require immediate attention
- **Review cadence:** Once per week
- **Examples:** Brokerage statements, investment newsletters, crypto alerts, bank notifications

### 3. Needs Reply → Stay in Inbox
- **Action:** Keep in inbox, surface in daily briefing
- **Criteria:** Direct question to Peter, request for action, awaiting his response

### 4. Promotions & Marketing → Archive
- **Action:** Archive immediately
- **No need to ask** for obvious marketing (sales, coupons, "limited time offer")

### 5. Car Dealerships → Delete
- **Action:** Auto-delete
- **Exception:** Keep anything about Peter's **2025 Honda Pilot**
- **Examples to delete:** Hyundai, Subaru, Acura inquiries/follow-ups

### 6. ToS/Policy Updates → Delete
- **Action:** Auto-delete
- **Examples:** "We updated our terms", "Changes to your agreement", policy notices
- **Rationale:** Peter will never read these

### 7. Health/Supplement Marketing → Delete + Unsubscribe
- **Action:** Unsubscribe, then delete
- **Unsubscribed from:** Mind Lab Pro, Ben Greenfield Fitness

### 5. Automated Notifications → Triage
- **GitHub:** Archive unless it's a mention or review request
- **Cloudflare/Infrastructure:** Archive unless it's an actual alert requiring action
- **Receipts/Confirmations:** Archive after brief check

---

## Aggressiveness Level

**Current: CONSERVATIVE**

- Flag/suggest rather than auto-archive (except obvious promotions)
- Ask before unsubscribing (until we build confidence)
- Surface anything uncertain for Peter's call

**Future:** Gradually increase to MODERATE as patterns become clear

---

## Priority Contacts (Always Surface)

**Rule:** If it looks like an email directly from a human being → it's important.

*(Building VIP list as we go)*

- *(will add as we learn)*
