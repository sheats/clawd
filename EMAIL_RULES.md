# EMAIL_RULES.md - Inbox Processing Rules

*Last updated: 2026-01-25*

## Philosophy

Peter doesn't use email for information/data consumption. Email is for **communication that requires action**. Everything else is noise.

---

## Rules

### 1. Newsletters & Subscriptions → Unsubscribe
- **Action:** Unsubscribe from everything
- **No dedicated inbox** — just cut the noise entirely
- **Exception:** If Peter explicitly says to keep one, whitelist it

### 2. Financial & Investment Emails → Label for Weekly Review
- **Action:** Label/star these but don't require immediate attention
- **Review cadence:** Once per week
- **Examples:** Brokerage statements, investment newsletters, crypto alerts, bank notifications

### 3. Needs Reply → Stay in Inbox
- **Action:** Keep in inbox, surface in daily briefing
- **Criteria:** Direct question to Peter, request for action, awaiting his response

### 4. Promotions & Marketing → Archive
- **Action:** Archive immediately
- **No need to ask** for obvious marketing (sales, coupons, "limited time offer")

### 11. Unsolicited Service Marketing → Delete
- **Action:** Auto-delete
- **Intent:** Cold outreach or marketing from services Peter never signed up for
- **Signals:**
  - Home warranty/home services spam (AFC Home Club, etc.)
  - Extended warranty offers
  - "You've been selected" / "Exclusive offer" from unknown senders
  - No prior relationship or purchase history
- **Distinction from Rule 4:** Promotions from known brands → archive. Cold spam from randoms → delete.

### 5. Car Dealerships → Delete
- **Action:** Auto-delete
- **Exception:** Keep anything about Peter's **2025 Honda Pilot**
- **Examples to delete:** Hyundai, Subaru, Acura inquiries/follow-ups

### 6. ToS/Policy Updates → Delete
- **Action:** Auto-delete
- **Examples:** "We updated our terms", "Changes to your agreement", policy notices
- **Rationale:** Peter will never read these

### 7. Health/Supplement Marketing → Delete + Unsubscribe
- **Action:** Unsubscribe, then delete
- **Unsubscribed from:** Mind Lab Pro, Ben Greenfield Fitness

### 10. Payment Notifications → Archive
- **Action:** Auto-archive immediately
- **Intent:** Any confirmation that a payment was made or received
- **Signals:**
  - "Payment received", "Payment confirmed", "Payment successful"
  - "Thank you for your payment", "We received your payment"
  - "You've been paid", "Direct deposit", "Money received"
  - Utility/bill pay confirmations
  - Venmo/PayPal/Zelle transfer confirmations
- **Rationale:** Good to have on record, but doesn't need inbox attention

### 9. Survey Requests → Delete
- **Action:** Auto-delete
- **Intent:** Any email asking Peter to provide feedback, fill out a survey, rate an experience, or give input on a product/service
- **Signals:**
  - Subject contains: survey, feedback, rate, review, input, opinion, experience, "how was", "tell us", "quick question"
  - From domains: surveymonkey.com, typeform.com, qualtrics.com, getfeedback.com, delighted.com
  - Post-purchase/post-interaction timing ("How was your recent order?")
  - NPS-style asks ("On a scale of 1-10...")
- **Rationale:** Never going to fill these out — delete on sight

### 8. Order Updates & Shipping → Archive After 24 Hours
- **Action:** Auto-archive if older than 24 hours
- **Examples:** Shipping confirmations, delivery updates, tracking info, "your order has shipped", "out for delivery", "delivered"
- **Rationale:** Useful in the moment, but stale quickly — no need to clutter inbox

### 5. Automated Notifications → Triage
- **GitHub:** Archive unless it's a mention or review request
- **Cloudflare/Infrastructure:** Archive unless it's an actual alert requiring action
- **Receipts/Confirmations:** Archive after brief check

---

## Aggressiveness Level

**Current: CONSERVATIVE**

- Flag/suggest rather than auto-archive (except obvious promotions)
- Ask before unsubscribing (until we build confidence)
- Surface anything uncertain for Peter's call

**Future:** Gradually increase to MODERATE as patterns become clear

---

## Priority Contacts (Always Surface)

**Rule:** If it looks like an email directly from a human being → it's important.

*(Building VIP list as we go)*
