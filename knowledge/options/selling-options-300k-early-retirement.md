## Key Concept

Selling options with $300k could generate around $10k/month to cover expenses and achieve early retirement. Not as crazy as it seems - a straightforward strategy compared to other approaches.

## Strategy Details

### Delta
- Use **delta 0.20** for put selling
- @ken100bands mentions 10 delta for MSTR specifically

### Stock/ETF Selection
- Different each week depending on where they're trading relative to support
- Recent examples: NVDA, HIMS
- For beginners: SPY and QQQ are safer (indices) but require more cash collateral
- Lower capital alternatives: TQQQ and TNA (3x leveraged funds - more risk but less capital needed)

### Time Commitment
- Can be done with less than 5 hours/week including research (@drp825_)

## Key Insights from Discussion

1. **Once experienced, it's like a cheat code** - Takes patience and dedication initially
2. **Not "set it and forget it"** - Requires managing volatility, assignment risk, and disciplined strategy (@IMSTUCKINVR)
3. **Selling > Buying** - "Getting paid for the risk you're taking on, not hoping for a big payoff" (@onlypeterpru)
4. **Compound strategy** - Sell covered calls, use profits to buy more shares, sell even more CC (@mjpowers210 with MARA in 2023)
5. **First third is hardest** - Getting to $100k takes the most discipline

## Complementary Strategy

Options can complement dividend investing:
- Use options income to boost account and add more income-producing assets
- Some users target $10k/month from dividends as the end goal, using options to accelerate

## Key Risks to Manage
- Volatility
- Assignment risk
- Requires disciplined strategy
- Leveraged ETFs (TQQQ, TNA) carry additional risk
