## The Concept

Selling options with $300k capital could be a path to early retirement:
- Generate around $10k/month in income
- Cover your expenses
- Say goodbye to the 9-5

## Key Numbers

- **Capital Required:** $300,000
- **Monthly Target:** ~$10,000
- **Yield:** ~3.3% monthly / ~40% annually

## Considerations

- This assumes consistent premium selling
- Risk management is critical
- Need to understand options mechanics
- Account for drawdowns and losing streaks
