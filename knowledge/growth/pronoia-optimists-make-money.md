The most successful people I know all have an almost irrational belief that everything will work out.

The word for it: **Pronoia.**

It means the opposite of paranoia. The belief that the world is secretly conspiring in your favor.

## Why Pronoia Works

The funny thing about Pronoia is that it's **self-fulfilling.**

When you believe things will work out:
- You try harder
- You persist longer
- You see opportunities where others see dead ends
