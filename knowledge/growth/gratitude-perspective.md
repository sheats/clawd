If you don't get flooded with gratitude multiple times a week, you're missing something:

## What We Take for Granted

- We live in a free country
- Gyms exist
- Christopher Nolan movies exist
- NFL Sundays happen 20+ times a year
- You can build yourself into a superhero in a few months of hitting the gym
- Every food item in the world has been hunted and gathered for you (grocery stores)
- You didn't have to spend your entire life figuring out how to make a car... you were born into a world where they're already invented
- You could be working in a coal mine in a third world country 16 hours a day breaking your lower back for less than $1

## The Miracle

You're spinning on a sphere in an infinite universe and the fact you're alive is a **1 in 500 trillion miracle.**

## The Rule

If anyone complains in front of you, tell them they're missing the bigger picture.
