*"Happiness is just a product of good habits"*

## 1. Say No by Default

Your time is precious — don't give it to people who don't deserve it.

Especially Energy Vampires who drain your energy.

**Rule:** If it's not a f*ck yes, it's a no.

## 2. Get Addicted to Learning

Put time aside daily before bed to read.

Your information diet is like your actual diet: if you eat crap, you'll feel crap.

## 3. Prioritize Nature

Study of 20,000 people: **120 minutes/week in nature** improved health and well-being.

Nature is the planet's greatest healer.

## 4. Morning Routine

Doesn't need to be 4 hours or involve a cold plunge. Nail the basics:
- No phone first thing
- A small win early (e.g., light exercise)
- Mind primed for deep work (e.g., journaling)

*Your morning is the stretching before the sprint.*

## 5. Embrace Loneliness

Twice a month, do something normally "social" alone:
- Eat dinner alone
- Go to the park alone
- Attend a movie alone

Solitude is essential to truly knowing yourself.

## 6. Choose Writing Over Complaining

Complaining repels ambitious people and fosters negativity.

Write down your thoughts instead — forces slow, deep thinking.

*It's the therapy your therapist uses.*

## 7. Pay it Forward

Random acts of kindness boost well-being:
- Hold the door
- Pick up trash
- Give a compliment

The world's a closed system: positivity finds its way back.

## 8. Maintain Relationships

Human connections are the fabric of life — be intentional.

Schedule time weekly for thoughtful texts and calls to those you've neglected.

*A couple of minutes with an ROI measured in years.*

## 9. Focus on Your Health

Most mental health problems are actually physical health problems.

People who:
- Eat well
- Exercise daily
- Drink enough water

Have a Teflon mind that repels negativity.
