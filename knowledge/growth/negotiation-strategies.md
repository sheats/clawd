## 1. Anchoring

Use "shock value" of a VERY high/low offer to create a reference point.

When the real offer is presented, it's compared to YOUR anchor and appears like a bargain.

**Example:** Submit an offer on property 25% below asking. Then "concede" to 5% below. Creates perceived value for the seller.

---

## 2. Loss Aversion

Humans place more emphasis on a loss than an equal gain. Wins feel good, but losses HURT.

Position a deal NOT getting done as something lost (opportunity, market share, etc.)

**Example:** "If interest rates rise, the value of this property may go down $200K." Inaction becomes costly.

---

## 3. Specificity

Using specific numbers leads to better outcomes (Columbia University research).

A hyper-specific offer suggests deep understanding of value.

**Example:** Offer $10,517 instead of $10,500. Perceived as an expert, you'll avoid the markup.

## 4. Reciprocity

People HATE to be in debt — it's wired deep into our psyche.

Create feelings of indebtedness with small, personalized, meaningful gifts.

**Example:** Send their favorite expensive whiskey with a thoughtful note. Helps get that final concession.

## 5. Make It Win-Win

"You must never try to get all the money in a deal, let the other fellow get some too." — John Paul Getty

If you're known for "winning" every negotiation, eventually no one will do deals with you.

**Tactic:** Create a list of 'no concession' points. Never violate these. But budge on smaller points to demonstrate good faith.

## 6. Forced Empathy (Chris Voss technique)

Use questions that force the other side to understand your position.

Instead of emotional responses to unreasonable demands, ask:
- "How am I supposed to do that?"
- "How can we both win here?"
