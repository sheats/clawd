## The Lessons

1. **Saving is a hedge** against life's inevitable ability to surprise the hell out of you at the worst possible moment.

2. **Planning is important**, but the most important part of every plan is to plan on the plan not going according to plan.

3. **An investing genius** is the man who can do the average thing when all those around him are going crazy.

4. **People are poor forecasters** of their future selves.

5. **Controlling your time** is the highest dividend money pays.

6. **Understand your time horizon** and don't be persuaded by people playing different games than you.

7. **Building wealth** has little to do with your income or investment returns, and lots to do with your savings rate.

8. **The hardest financial skill** is getting the goalpost to stop moving.

9. **Past a certain level of income**, what you need is just what sits below your ego.

10. **No one is impressed** with your possessions as much as you are.

11. **The line between "inspiringly bold" and "foolishly reckless"** can be a millimeter thick and only visible with hindsight.

12. **There is no reason to risk** what you have and need for what you don't have and don't need.

13. **Good investing** is not about making good decisions — it's about consistently not screwing up.

14. **History can be misleading** — the further back you look, the more general your takeaways should be.

15. **Go out of your way to find humility** when things are going right, and forgiveness/compassion when they go wrong.

16. **Progress happens too slowly to notice**, but setbacks happen too quickly to ignore.

17. **There is no greater force in finance than room for error** — the higher the stakes, the wider it should be.

18. **Everyone has an incomplete view of the world** but forms a complete narrative to fill the gaps. "Risk is what's left over when you think you've thought of everything."

19. **Have more expectations and fewer forecasts** — expectations provide vision stripped of false precision.

20. **Nurture the ability to move on** from ideas you wish were permanent when the world changes. "Being right is the enemy of staying right."

21. **Investing is not the study of finance** — it's the study of how people behave with money.
