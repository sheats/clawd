1. **Ask him what he was like at your age** — because once he was the same age you are right now. Watch his face light up as he tells you stories from when he was younger.

2. **Record his laugh** when he tells one of his signature jokes. Someday you will replay the video over and over just to hear it again.

3. **Ask him about the proudest moment of his life.** (Odds are he will say when you were born)

4. **Ask him his favourite songs.** Listen to them together, laugh, sing and be happy. These will become your most cherished memories in years to come.

5. **Take a picture of him doing something he loves.** Watching TV, gardening, playing the guitar, anything. When you look back, these will be the pictures that will make you smile the most.

6. **Tell him you love him** — even if it's something you don't normally do.

7. **Tell him you are proud to be his son/daughter.** This will mean more to him than you realise (even if he doesn't show it).

8. **Listen to music from his youth** and watch him turn from dad into a young man again.

9. **Take a short video of him talking about something random.** Someday even the ordinary things he said become sacred.

10. **Bring up something you are thankful for from years ago.**

11. **Ask him what it was like for him growing up.**

12. **Call him for no reason.** Don't take being able to do this for granted. Someday you would give anything to hear his voice again.

13. **Take a picture of just the 2 of you together.**

14. **Ask him to show you an old photo of him** — because seeing him young will remind you that he wasn't always Dad.

15. **Tell him something you are struggling with, no matter what age you are.** Because even when you're grown it means the world to him to feel like he can still help. Let him give you advice, even if you don't need it — because one day you will give anything to hear his voice guiding you again.
