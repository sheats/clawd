*Note: This is presented as a story/framework. Author later admitted to "engagement baiting" but the business model itself is real and used by some founders.*

## The Model

- **Service:** Ghostwriting replies/comments on X for founders
- **Rate:** $3,200/month per client
- **Clients:** 11 founders
- **Revenue:** $35,200/month
- **Work:** ~300 replies per day across all accounts

## Why Founders Pay for This

> "Replies from the founder's account build trust faster than posts. But founders are too busy to sit on X for 3 hours a day."

**Key insight:** Posts averaged 2K views. Replies were getting seen by 50K-100K people every day because they were first comment on big accounts.

## The Onboarding Process

1. Ask for 10 examples of how they talk
2. Get their opinions on common topics
3. Understand their humor style
4. "Then I just become them in the comments"

## Results Example

- One client went from 400 followers to 12,000 in 4 months
- Closed $180K in deals
- He said half came from people who found him through replies

## How to Get Clients

1. DM'd 50 founders
2. Offered to do it **free for 2 weeks**
3. 9 said yes
4. 6 became paying clients
5. Then referrals

## Key Points

- **You don't need a big following** - "They're not paying for my audience. They're paying for my time and my ability to sound like them."
- No content creation required
- No strategy calls
- No deliverables besides comments
- The $3,200/month is treated as an advertising expense by founders

## Commentary from Thread

> "It's a service and a valuable one at that." - @redspit1

> "Time is the most precious commodity to entrepreneurs. They need to be visible. They need to seem authentic." - @KatMartinez0001

> "Attention is cheap. Ownership and repeat revenue are what compound." - @Dxnielmonte

**Skepticism note:** Many in the thread doubt the specific numbers. However, the core business model (ghostwriting social media engagement for busy founders) is legitimate and used in the industry.
