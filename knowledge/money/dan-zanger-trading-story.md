## The Story

There is a trader who ran an account from **$10,775 to $42,000,000 in 23 months.**

During that run he set the record for the single biggest return in a year: **29,000% ($18,000,000).**

His name is **Dan Zanger.** He sold his car to fund his trading account.

## The Method

- **Win rate:** ~40%
- **Risk per trade:** 3-5%
- **Approach:** Strict mechanical setup
- **Trades:** ~1,000 during the dot com bubble
- **Strategy:** Ruthlessly exploit edge, compound capital as fast as math allows

## The Lesson

He recognized that with positive expectancy, the only rational thing to do was ruthlessly exploit his edge every chance he got and compound his capital as fast as the math would allow.

## The Takeaway

> These things are possible. The only thing stopping any of you is the skillset, experience, and discipline.
>
> And when you finally get an edge, and the skills to trade it, **exploit it as much as humanely possible.**
