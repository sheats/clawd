# Triple Net (NNN) Properties

## What is a Triple Net Lease?

A **Triple Net (NNN) lease** is a commercial real estate lease where the tenant pays:

1. **Net property taxes**
2. **Net building insurance**  
3. **Net maintenance costs**

...in addition to rent and utilities. The landlord receives "net" rent with minimal ongoing expenses.

## Why Investors Like NNN Properties

- **Passive income:** Tenant handles most expenses and property management
- **Predictable cash flow:** Long-term leases (10-25 years) with creditworthy tenants
- **Low management burden:** Often called "mailbox money"
- **Inflation protection:** Many leases include rent escalation clauses

## Common NNN Tenants

- Fast food chains (McDonald's, Starbucks, Chick-fil-A)
- Pharmacies (Walgreens, CVS)
- Dollar stores (Dollar General, Dollar Tree)
- Auto parts stores (AutoZone, O'Reilly)
- Banks and gas stations

## Considerations

- High upfront cost (typically $1M+)
- Tenant credit quality matters
- Lease expiration risk
- Location and real estate fundamentals still matter
