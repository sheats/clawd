## The Claim

> "I make about $30k a month with options."

**What he DOESN'T do:**
- Day trading
- Swing trading
- Covered calls
- Cash secured puts

## The Strategy

1. **Build base portfolio** (stocks you want to own)
2. **Sell portfolio secured puts** (not cash secured)
3. **Buy LEAPS** with the premium from sold puts
4. **Buy shares** with the premium from sold puts
5. **All 1+ year option contracts**

> "I can explain it to a 13 year old & I will likely outperform 95% of people that read this. Simple wins."

## Key Concept: Portfolio Secured Puts

Unlike cash-secured puts (which require holding cash as collateral), portfolio secured puts use your existing stock holdings as collateral.

**Brokerages that allow this:** Schwab, E*Trade, Public
