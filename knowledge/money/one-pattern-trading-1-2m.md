Story of a trader who made $1.2M trading last year with 847 followers, no course, no discord.

---

## The Background

When he started, he was like everyone else:
- 47 indicators
- 12 strategies
- Telegram signals
- News trading
- Scalping
- Swing trading
- Everything

**Result:** Blew $340k in 4 years.

His wife told him trading was over. Get a real job.

> "That's when I got serious."

## The System

He spent 6 months backtesting ONE setup: **Bullish engulfing at daily support.**

Over 3 years of data:
- **Win rate:** 61%
- **Average R:** 2.8

> "That was enough. I didn't need anything else."

## The Routine

- Wake up
- Check daily charts for 15 minutes
- If the setup is there, take it
- If not, play golf

> "Some weeks I take zero trades."

## Typical Month

- Trades: 8-12
- Winners: 5-7
- Losers: 3-5
- Average month: **$70-120k**

## The Transformation

- Screen time: **8 hours/day → 45 minutes/week**
- Income: **-$80k/year → +$1.2M/year**

**Inverse correlation.**

## The Key Insight

> "We've been told MORE effort = MORE results. But trading is inverted. LESS effort = MORE results."

Because effort in trading usually means:
- More trades (more mistakes)
- More screen time (more emotional decisions)
- More analysis (more paralysis)
- More indicators (more confusion)

## His Advice

> "Pick one setup. Test it. Prove it works. Then do ONLY that setup for 3 years. You'll be rich and everyone will think you're a genius. You're not. You're just patient."

## Final Wisdom

> "Everyone who tells you trading is hard is right. But not because the market is hard. Because DOING NOTHING is hard. That's the actual skill. Doing nothing while everyone else is busy losing money."
