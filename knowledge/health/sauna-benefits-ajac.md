## Key Points

- **Frequency**: 3-5 times a week, 15-30 minutes each session
- **Type**: Infrared sauna
- **Cost**: ~$6,000 with shipping
- **Vendor**: [Clearlight Saunas](https://www.clearlight-saunas.ca/) - mention AJAC for a deal

## Health Benefits

AJAC claims "overwhelming data on the health benefits" of sauna use, though some commenters note the research shows "modest benefits at best" for already healthy populations who exercise.

## Tips

- If you feel worse after sauna (poor sleep, heat dysregulation): You're likely dehydrated and not replenishing lost minerals
- Can be done daily (7x a week according to some users)
- Infrared saunas are different from Finnish-style hot saunas - AJAC suggests infrared is effective despite claims that temps need to be 170°F+

## Discussion Points

- Heat from saunas is not the same as outdoor heat in hot climates
- Concerns about testicle heat were dismissed (AJAC has two kids)
- Some skepticism about "overwhelming data" claims - may be overstated for healthy exercising populations
