*Source: @bensmithlive on X, October 2024*

## The Problem

Our nervous system didn't evolve to handle constant stimulation. Today's world floods us with constant stimuli—causing chronic dysregulation.

## 15 Simple Lifestyle Changes

### 1. Switch aggressive music to healing sounds
- Aggressive music creates agitation (adrenaline flowing)
- Try hand-pan music while working

### 2. Switch coffee to ceremonial cacao
- Coffee increases cortisol
- Chronic elevation → chronic stress → burnout
- Ceremonial cacao provides boost with added benefits

### 3. Switch ice baths to Epsom salt bath
- Rich in magnesium sulphate
- Reduces muscle tension and inflammation
- Can still do ice baths, but with proper parasympathetic activation

### 4. Switch wireless headphones to wired earphones
- Reduce EMF exposure to brain
- "Don't fry your brain for hours every day"

### 5. Switch meditation to breathwork
- Meditation takes months; breathwork can work in one session
- **Double Inhales technique:**
  1. Breathe in until "full"
  2. Take another short-sharp inhale through nose
  3. Breathe out fully over 12 seconds
  4. Repeat as needed

### 6. Switch bottled beer to kombucha
- Avoid alcohol to reset

### 7. Switch podcasts during travel to presence
- Re-connection with the moment

### 8. Switch mindless scrolling to intentional scroll
- Or don't scroll at all

### 9. Switch iPhone alarm to Sleep Cycle app
- Tracks sleep phases via sound patterns
- Wakes you during lightest sleep within 30-min window
- Clinically proven to reduce morning grogginess

### 10. Switch hustle culture to strategic rest
- Constant cognitive load depletes prefrontal cortex function
- 4 hours deep focused work > 12 hours scattered tasks
- Peak performance requires rest

### 11. Switch light mode to dark mode
- Blue light disrupts circadian rhythm, melatonin production, sleep quality
- Phone becomes less interesting → less cheap dopamine chasing

### 12. Switch fasting to morning fats and protein
- Stress hormones spike when you wake
- Skipping breakfast keeps stress high
- Start with eggs and avocado
- Gradually introduce carbs throughout day

### 13. Switch polyester to linen clothing
- Polyester contains endocrine-disrupting phthalates and dimethyl fumarate
- Synthetics accumulate in body through skin contact
- Linen allows skin to breathe, no artificial hormone disruptors

### 14. Switch primary phone to 2nd phone
Uses:
- Set alarms (no media sources upon waking)
- Listen to mixes while working/training
- Receive 2FA codes through Google Voice
- Result: calmer and more productive

### 15. Switch closed shoes to barefoot contact (grounding)
- Feet loaded with nerve endings
- Earth's electrical frequency matches nervous and immune system
- Bare feet allow absorption of that energy
- "Universal anti-inflammatory medicine"
