*Source: Google Doc from biohacker community*

## Prerequisites

- Diet and exercise already dialed in
- This is "Do Your Own Research" territory

## Basic Level (1 compound)

### Retatrutide
*"The king of fat loss peptides"*

- **Mechanism**: Triple action peptide binding to:
  - GLP-1 receptor
  - GIP receptor
  - Glucagon receptor
- **Results**: Greatest long-term fat loss in clinical trials

**Dosing Protocol**:
- Start: 1mg first week to assess tolerance
- Then: 1-2mg/week based on individual tolerance
- Over time: Increase by 1mg as needed (slow dose approach)

**Effects**:

- Controls food noise
- Upticks metabolism
- Scale drops within 7-10 days

## Super Charged Fat Loss (2 compounds)
*For first 4-8 weeks*

### 5-Amino-1MQ
- **Mechanism**: Selective inhibitor of NNMT (nicotinamide N-methyltransferase)
- **How it works**: 
  - Stops methylation of nicotinamide
  - Raises intracellular NAD+ levels
  - Supports better mitochondrial function
- **Benefits**:
  - Encourages fat breakdown
  - Reduces fat cell size
  - Lowers white adipose tissue
  - Works WITHOUT depending on reduced appetite
  - Steady weight reduction
  - Enhanced insulin sensitivity
  - Lower cholesterol

### SLU-PP-332
- **Mechanism**: Synthetic agonist of estrogen-related receptors (ERRα, ERRβ, ERRγ)
- **How it works**: Mimics physiological effects of exercise
- **Benefits**:
  - Enhanced mitochondrial function
  - Promotes fat oxidation
  - Increases metabolic rate WITHOUT physical activity
  - Reduced fat storage
  - Improved insulin sensitivity
  - Better glucose utilization
  - Shifts body toward using fatty acids as primary energy
  - Consistent weight reduction
  - Lowered body fat percentage
  - Enhanced endurance

## Expected Results

With above stacks + diet + training:
- **~1% bodyfat in bodyweight lost per week consistently**
- (Assuming you follow a DIET)
