*Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/KoMo-Duett-Flaker-Grain-Mill/dp/B004YTQHMI/*

## What It Is

A combo unit combining:
1. **KoMo Fidibus Classic mill** - stone grain mill
2. **KoMo FlocMan flaker** - for making fresh flakes

## Why Home Grain Milling?

- Superior nutrition from freshly milled flour
- Much better taste than store-bought
- Control over grind coarseness

## Features

- Gorgeous appearance, heavy-duty construction
- Very fast grinding (compared to KitchenAid attachment or Retsel)
- Adjustable grind settings (fine to coarse/"grob")
- Can process: wheat, rye, dried corn, barley, millet, oats

## Use Cases

### Milling
- Fine flour for bread
- Coarse whole-wheat flour for soakers
- Cracked wheat/rye
- Rye meal
- Cornmeal for cornbread

### Flaking
- Fresh rolled oats (far superior freshness)
- Wheat, rye, barley, millet flakes
- Note: Non-oat grains need softening with water first (3-4 hours drying)

## Accessories

KoMo Sifter available separately with three screens:
- ~96% extraction rate
- ~90% extraction rate
- ~74% extraction rate
- Can create custom flour blends (e.g., 85% extraction for Tartine recipes)

## Considerations

- Occasional "crunch" or "grit" in bread (possibly stone wear or improperly milled grain)
- Corn produces more fine flour with coarse pieces than wheat/rye
- Pleasant Hill Grain (seller) has great customer service

## Recommended Recipe

Whole Wheat Bread from "Bread Baker's Apprentice" by Peter Reinhart (p. 270)
- Uses overnight soaker of coarse whole-wheat flour
- Hard spring wheat recommended over winter wheat for 100% whole wheat bread
