## Key Principles

Dan Go shared a comprehensive infographic on reversing biological age. Key discussion points from the thread:

### Body Composition
- **Target body fat**: 10-19% for metabolically healthy
- **Visceral fat (VAT)**: As close to zero as possible
- Consider tracking body fat (though CT scans have high radiation - use alternatives)

### Social Connection (#7)
- Build community for longevity
- See friends weekly
- Share time doing activities
- Build a network of support
- Good relationships are vital for living long and well

### For Busy Parents
- Find parents in your community with similar values and children of similar age

### Mindset
- "The best time to start was yesterday. Next best time is now."
- Don't complain - it ages you
