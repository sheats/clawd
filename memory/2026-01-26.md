## Afternoon Session

### LinkedIn Brand Building — Session 1
- Ran first question session (ahead of Monday schedule)
- 7 questions answered, 3 skipped for later

**Highlights:**
- **Q1 (Outages):** Thanksgiving 2013 DB loss, K8s namespace deletion — both great war stories
- **Q3 (Wrong beliefs):** Tests slow you down, best code wins, need to have answers
- **Q5 (Hiring hot takes):** 6 unpopular opinions — resumes don't matter, scrappy > FAANG, years meaningless, etc.
- **Q6 (Tech debt):** No test foundation = can't refactor safely
- **Q8 (Saying no):** Tie features to market analysis + willingness to pay
- **Q9 (Decisions that paid off):** Kubernetes, Django

**Skipped for later:** Q2 (ship unready), Q4 (expensive mistake), Q7 (build vs buy), Q10 (best team)

**Content potential:** 10-15 LinkedIn posts from this session alone

Next session: Wednesday
