OK, so I want to catalog a different business idea here so I have Long had the passion to basically help young folks teenagers early 20s and then eventually anybody doesn't really matter your age make good financially literate decisions so we all know that high schools and colleges don't teach financial literacy any college kids just get a credit card at age at college and then they get debt and then they borrowed a buy car and I don't know what all the terms are in this and that and they just kind of stumbled their way through life so I just thought it'd be interesting to create an iPhone mobile device base game that essentially is kind of like a turn based game where you go once by month is starting at age 18 and you make different decisions so one decision could be to get a college degree. They could maybe decide to do a summer job or part-time job conversation might be to work on a YouTube channel other decision while they're in college another decision is not to go to college and you know I'll do good in the blue collar traits right and essentially we should bring in things like investing in the stock market getting life insurance getting full life insurance is a mistake but I feel like I mean and all this other things that they can make you know so what kind of house to buy? how much to pay for rent, but if they rent versus buy what if they lease versus buy a car so they got all these decisions, maintaining credit card balance lifestyle, choices and then of course more complicated. They need to kind of alligator. They don't have unlimited time week when they get married and they have kids that's gonna take up their time so they can't really do a college and that right or their health suffer so those are all these trade-offs right and you know I guess I thought if you can make it fun make an iPhone mobile based eventually, you can make it multiplayer so you can play your friends challenge that I think the ideas that you would simulate all these things for each game you would create a I'm ation that would predict kind of the stock market action the silver and gold action. I don't think we bring crypto into it. That seems a little bit too easy of a win, but who knows how much we want to add you start with the basics and essentially once they start to gain everything's pre-calculated as to each month what it's gonna happen and basically somebody would be able to get a full financial education through playing this game multiple times it would be very simple at the start, but our users can dig into the details and maybe be more interesting decisions but all of that will be geared towards learning so it's definitely very much education part of it and maybe someday old schools and high school psychologist could pay for this. You can get started by obviously you can use TikTok, YouTube and other platforms to create an audience around this idea of you don't know what you're doing. You don't get taught this. You pay attention to us. We'll teach you and they could be bite-size little videos about different things there's a lot of companies that are doing something similar to this, but I think turning it into a turn based mobile friendly game that you can play friends and you can break and you can kind of simulate a whole life with one to one game and see where you end up when you get to be 90 in other there's definitely gotta be different aspects of scores so you gotta basically score well with health score well with wealth relationships all these different currencies capital social capital power influence essentially the game of life and I could bring it all kinds of fun things like Scott Adams how to hack your life trying to get credit to him different different like basically could be a learn how to live life well with the focus on finances kind of platform. I don't know first of all I don't know catalog this.

Just to be clear, I want that saved burden. I don't want you to save a summary of what I sent you. I want verbatim every word I sent you to be saved in a log somewhere that we can reference and use later. Make sure that your master agent stuff, EY and whatever document we you use to decide your behavior has this instructions
