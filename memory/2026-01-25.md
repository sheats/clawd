## Voice Call Setup (TODO)

Peter wants to set up real phone calls with North for walking conversations.

**Options discussed:**
- Clawdbot `voice-call` plugin (Twilio or Telnyx)
- Requires: phone number, API keys, webhook/tunnel setup

**Next steps when ready:**
1. Choose provider (Twilio vs Telnyx)
2. Get a phone number
3. Configure plugin in gateway config
4. Set up webhook (ngrok or Tailscale funnel)

## Session: Afternoon (16:19 EST)

**Context:** Previous session got killed because tasks weren't processed correctly. Started fresh.

### Created MASTER_PLAN.md
Peter's life operating system with 10 core areas:
- 🎯 Current Season (quarterly priorities)
- 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦 Family
- ✝️ Faith
- 💪 Health
- 💼 Business (High Cotton, ReturnZap)
- 🧑‍💻 Career/Brand
- 💰 Money
- 🌱 Growth
- 🏠 Home
- 🔥 Freedom

File location: `/Users/sheats/clawd/MASTER_PLAN.md`
Status: Structure created, placeholders in place, Peter will fill in over time.

### X Bookmarks Strategy
**Goal:** Daily automated processing of X bookmarks into searchable knowledge base.

Workflow:
1. Fetch X bookmarks daily
2. Extract full thread content (not just bookmarked tweet)
3. Categorize by MASTER_PLAN areas
4. Store as searchable markdown files
5. North can reference during brainstorming or find on demand

**Status:** Strategy documented at `memory/strategies/x-bookmarks.md`. Need to:
- [ ] Set up bird CLI authentication
- [ ] Create storage structure
- [ ] Build processing workflow
- [ ] Set up daily cron job

### Memory lesson
Peter flagged that I need to save important stuff more aggressively during sessions, not wait for compaction. Write as we go.

## Session: Late Afternoon (16:30-17:00 EST)

### Bookmark Processing System - COMPLETED

**What we built:**
1. Created MASTER_PLAN.md with 10 life areas for categorization
2. Set up knowledge base structure (`knowledge/` with category subfolders)
3. Tested workflow: extract content → save markdown → delete/unbookmark → commit

**Processing completed:**
- Todoist: ~50+ items processed across 2 batches (books, health, growth, business, crypto, dividends, etc.)
- X Bookmarks: 50 processed, 11 valuable pieces saved, 39 low-value skipped

**Automation:**
- Daily cron job set up: `x-bookmarks-daily` runs at 6 AM
- No more Todoist for bookmarks — Peter using X bookmarks only going forward

**Sub-agents used:**
- `todoist-cleanup` — processed Todoist backlog
- `x-bookmarks` — processed X bookmarks
Both ran in parallel successfully.

**Knowledge base now contains:** 40+ files across books/, business/, crypto/, dividends/, faith/, freedom/, growth/, health/, home/, money/

## Productivity System Setup

**Time tracking:** Timing app installed (Mac)
- Automatic tracking, local data
- Will use for planned vs actual time analysis

**Planned workflow:**
1. North pushes daily tasks to Todoist (with time estimates)
2. Todoist syncs to calendar
3. Peter executes
4. Timing captures actual time
5. North reviews: planned vs actual, weekly rollup by MASTER_PLAN area
